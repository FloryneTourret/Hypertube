00:02:08.747 --> 00:02:10.805
No, no, no, bro! We're not here for you!
Don't even think about it!

00:02:10.815 --> 00:02:12.542
Don't you move,
motherfucker!

00:02:12.552 --> 00:02:14.922
Hands away from the weapon, bro!
Fucking relax!

00:02:17.523 --> 00:02:19.382
3170. We're being held up.

00:02:19.392 --> 00:02:22.418
Armor piercing rounds
are chambered in this firearm!

00:02:22.428 --> 00:02:25.388
Please don't be the asshole
who forces me to use them.

00:02:25.398 --> 00:02:27.524
Take your foot off the gas,

00:02:27.534 --> 00:02:30.758
press the unlock button,
and step out of the vehicle,

00:02:30.768 --> 00:02:32.727
or we will forcibly
remove you!

00:02:32.737 --> 00:02:36.042
Fucking do it! Now!

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.411
Your choice! Go!

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:59.089
What the fuck!

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.123
He fucking went for his gun.

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:03.303
He spilled his fucking coffee.

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:13.103
Shit.

00:03:13.113 --> 00:03:14.114
Gardena, 30 seconds out.

00:03:14.914 --> 00:03:16.205
Copy.

00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:17.783
Thirty out. Hustle!

00:03:21.387 --> 00:03:22.889
- Pop it.
- Ready.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.599
Man on!

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:41.797
Out of fucking time.

00:03:41.807 --> 00:03:43.466
Prepare to engage.

00:03:43.476 --> 00:03:45.001
Contact right!

00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:47.577
Range 100. Suppressive fire.

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:01.259
Contact left!

00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:05.832
Dispatch, 10-97.
LAPD is on scene.

00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:20.647
We are under heavy fire!

00:04:42.801 --> 00:04:43.803
Fuck!

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.078
Motherfucker!

00:05:00.886 --> 00:05:02.922
Whoa, whoa.
I got you. I got you.

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:22.109
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

00:05:43.295 --> 00:05:44.752
What the fuck was that?

00:05:44.762 --> 00:05:46.222
Did you see him
go for his gun?

00:05:46.232 --> 00:05:49.436
I don't know.
I just saw Bosco lit him up.

00:05:55.941 --> 00:05:58.200
Take the second left
into the tunnel.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.114
Hug the airport.
Take the tunnel.

00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:20.788
Go right on Doty.

00:06:20.798 --> 00:06:22.001
<i>Right on Doty.</i>

00:07:30.203 --> 00:07:32.128
Make sure you take care
of those weapons.

00:07:32.138 --> 00:07:34.208
I don't want any
accidental discharges.

00:07:35.741 --> 00:07:37.967
- What are you looking at him for?
- Ray.

00:07:37.977 --> 00:07:39.234
I'm not talking to him.
I'm talking to you.

00:07:39.244 --> 00:07:40.547
What the fuck was that?

00:07:49.054 --> 00:07:50.420
What else
did you fuck up, huh?

00:07:52.357 --> 00:07:54.261
You sure you were clean
all the way home?

00:07:55.061 --> 00:07:56.263
Catch any tails?

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:05.405
Where did Marcus
take those rounds?

00:08:08.574 --> 00:08:10.742
Femoral artery. He's done.

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:16.573
Well, we knew the risks.

00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:18.585
Shit popped off.
We handled it. That's it.

00:08:25.857 --> 00:08:26.927
Hey, B.

00:08:28.093 --> 00:08:30.085
Get back over there.

00:08:30.095 --> 00:08:32.221
See who responded.
It was probably LASD.

00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:34.755
They'll supersede Gardena,

00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:37.271
but if it's Major Crimes,
we've got a problem.

00:08:44.611 --> 00:08:46.868
All clear? No GPS?

00:08:46.878 --> 00:08:48.948
It's one of the old models, man.
We good.

00:08:51.117 --> 00:08:52.784
We've got to
get this patched up.

00:08:53.386 --> 00:08:54.621
We need this clean.

00:09:01.294 --> 00:09:02.563
You good?

00:09:05.298 --> 00:09:06.967
We're cop killers now.

00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:34.427
Well, that looks
like it hurt.

00:09:36.094 --> 00:09:37.096
No?

00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:40.655
Good morning,
fellow officers.

00:09:40.665 --> 00:09:41.991
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:43.092
Yeah?

00:09:43.102 --> 00:09:45.028
I take it he's a bad guy.

00:09:45.038 --> 00:09:46.827
You mean the guy
with the black body armor,

00:09:46.837 --> 00:09:48.830
shotgun, and gas mask?

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.434
That's very funny.
We know who he is yet?

00:09:51.444 --> 00:09:52.445
Rough night?

00:09:53.045 --> 00:09:55.103
Yes. Next subject?

00:09:55.113 --> 00:09:56.938
You're not looking
so hot there, bubba.

00:09:56.948 --> 00:09:58.875
I think he
looks amazing.

00:09:58.885 --> 00:10:02.310
You better start downing the POM juice,
big man. We've got a piss test Friday.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.179
Thursday.

00:10:04.189 --> 00:10:06.381
What, like you Mormons have been
drinking wheatgrass all fucking month?

00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:07.850
Please.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.519
You got another one of those?
I'm fucking starving.

00:10:09.529 --> 00:10:11.054
Yeah, there's a
couple that don't have blood.

00:10:11.064 --> 00:10:14.789
I think it's one of the
pinkies with the sprinkles.

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:16.958
- That's some real donut.
- Okay, what's the tally?

00:10:16.968 --> 00:10:18.493
Those are horrendous, dude.

00:10:18.503 --> 00:10:20.896
We've got four dead, six on
the way to the hospital.

00:10:20.906 --> 00:10:22.899
- But they'll be all right.
- Fuck.

00:10:22.909 --> 00:10:25.701
Ambushed them as they
were coming to get breakfast.

00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:27.370
Surrounded the truck.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.039
This poor fool right here was trying
to do what he gets paid to do.

00:10:30.049 --> 00:10:33.409
AP rounds blasted through
the windshield took him out.

00:10:33.419 --> 00:10:37.212
They took the truck, Gardena police
lost them under Hawthorne Municipal.

00:10:37.222 --> 00:10:38.581
They knew the route.

00:10:38.591 --> 00:10:41.550
Picked it because it was
next to Municipal Airport,

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.064
knew the restricted air space
meant no ghetto bird air support.

00:10:46.731 --> 00:10:49.991
We're dealing with a different
animal here, boys.

00:10:50.001 --> 00:10:52.328
Talk to the armored car company?
What was the haul?

00:10:52.338 --> 00:10:54.896
They were en route to a bank
pickup for a Fed drop.

00:10:54.906 --> 00:10:56.266
But there was nothing
in the truck.

00:10:56.774 --> 00:10:57.944
Nothing in the truck?

00:11:00.346 --> 00:11:01.948
They stole a fucking
empty armored truck?

00:11:02.247 --> 00:11:03.547
Yup.

00:11:05.418 --> 00:11:07.410
Why the fireworks?

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.541
One of the vics said the messenger went
for his gun. That's when it popped off.

00:11:11.424 --> 00:11:12.748
Genius.

00:11:12.758 --> 00:11:14.750
Okay, the SUV,
what have we got?

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.519
That's a cold car.

00:11:16.529 --> 00:11:19.721
VIN's been pried off. Plates are stolen.
No prints on it.

00:11:19.731 --> 00:11:21.390
They bleach-bombed it.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:26.637
Right. Take it to SID. Tent that fucker.
Swab it. Detail it.

00:11:35.113 --> 00:11:38.406
Ah, fuck. I can't deal with
this retard factory this early.

00:11:38.416 --> 00:11:40.108
One of you guys handle it?

00:11:40.118 --> 00:11:41.253
It's all you, bro.

00:11:42.387 --> 00:11:44.280
Thank you.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.882
All right, witnesses,
donut shop guy?

00:11:46.892 --> 00:11:48.550
He saw them, and they
looked right at him,

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.296
but, for some reason,
they left him alone.

00:11:53.632 --> 00:11:56.992
Okay, pull all video surveillance and
plate readers. Do a Palantir run.

00:11:57.002 --> 00:11:58.294
Talk to DOT, okay?

00:11:58.304 --> 00:12:01.563
Pull it all together,
and meet me at the office.

00:12:01.573 --> 00:12:03.477
And find me
that fucking truck.

00:12:07.012 --> 00:12:11.307
Big Nick, original gangsta
cop in the flesh.

00:12:11.317 --> 00:12:13.576
Lobbin' Bob. Huh?

00:12:13.586 --> 00:12:15.322
How's that
mean tennis game?

00:12:20.759 --> 00:12:22.318
Look at you, man.

00:12:22.328 --> 00:12:24.153
Where'd you pick that up?
Nice suit.

00:12:24.163 --> 00:12:27.522
Well, not where you're shopping.
I can't afford it.

00:12:27.532 --> 00:12:29.958
I mean, how does
a county sheriff

00:12:29.968 --> 00:12:32.660
pay for such a beautiful
piece of men's fashion?

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.030
You kidding me? This piece of shit?
Nah, this is garbage.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.265
Look at you.

00:12:36.275 --> 00:12:38.300
This thing's tits!

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.669
You must pull all kinds
of ass sporting that, no?

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:43.771
Nick, you know what?
I can't. I can't.

00:12:43.781 --> 00:12:47.543
It's too early in the morning
for your fucking circus.

00:12:47.553 --> 00:12:49.846
You just threw
a donut in the hot zone.

00:12:49.856 --> 00:12:51.613
- No. I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

00:12:51.623 --> 00:12:53.682
I did?
That was fucking wrong.

00:12:53.692 --> 00:12:56.017
It was. I don't like you, Nick, or
how you handle police business...

00:12:56.027 --> 00:12:57.829
Hey, hey, hey.
What's up with that?

00:12:58.631 --> 00:13:00.188
I like you.

00:13:00.198 --> 00:13:02.357
Aside from the fact
that you're a vegetarian.

00:13:02.367 --> 00:13:04.861
Vegan! I'm a vegan.

00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:06.962
- Vegetarians, they eat milk...
- Yeah, sorry to hear that.

00:13:06.972 --> 00:13:09.030
What are you
doing here anyway, huh?

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.745
No legal tender was stolen.
It isn't Federal.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.081
Yet.

00:13:17.149 --> 00:13:18.818
You're pausing
for dramatic effect?

00:13:22.721 --> 00:13:24.391
You're such a big,
bad lieutenant.

00:13:25.223 --> 00:13:27.315
- I know. I know.
- Yeah.

00:13:27.325 --> 00:13:30.062
Can I go now, Dad?
I'm kind of hungry.

00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:39.594
So Gardena showed up,
and they secured the scene,

00:13:39.604 --> 00:13:42.731
and then these clowns
took over.

00:13:42.741 --> 00:13:44.366
Who are they, LASD?

00:13:44.376 --> 00:13:47.236
Yeah, Sheriff's. They must be.
Look at this clown right here.

00:13:47.246 --> 00:13:48.515
He seemed to be in charge.

00:14:03.462 --> 00:14:05.453
You recognize him?

00:14:05.463 --> 00:14:07.622
He played football at South.

00:14:07.632 --> 00:14:10.603
Remember Endo?
Filipino dude the cops killed?

00:14:10.937 --> 00:14:12.361
Yeah.

00:14:12.371 --> 00:14:14.362
That's the cop
who blasted him.

00:14:14.372 --> 00:14:16.265
Runs Major Crimes.

00:14:16.275 --> 00:14:18.111
Get to know your enemy, boys.

00:14:27.453 --> 00:14:29.911
Who's running this crew?

00:14:29.921 --> 00:14:32.481
Probably two, three guys
that can pull this off, max.

00:14:32.491 --> 00:14:37.453
Why steal an armored truck
with nothing in it?

00:14:37.463 --> 00:14:39.621
Bad tip,
they probably botched it.

00:14:39.631 --> 00:14:41.089
Why didn't they dump it, then?

00:14:41.099 --> 00:14:43.259
- I'll check the salvage yards.
- All of them.

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:47.496
And how'd they know about a transfer
from the casino to the Fed,

00:14:47.506 --> 00:14:51.832
especially one that wasn't scheduled
through the regular carrier? How?

00:14:51.842 --> 00:14:54.337
It was an inside job, bro.
It had to be.

00:14:54.347 --> 00:14:57.305
Oh, fuck.
Give me the Pepto.

00:14:57.315 --> 00:14:59.976
Okay, inside job, but where?

00:14:59.986 --> 00:15:03.822
Right? Was it the casino, the bank, the
Fed, the fucking donut shop? Where?

00:15:04.991 --> 00:15:06.425
What about Merrimen?

00:15:09.827 --> 00:15:11.486
When did he parole again?

00:15:11.496 --> 00:15:14.300
- Eight months ago.
- Eight months ago?

00:15:15.934 --> 00:15:18.827
We need to find
that fucking truck.

00:15:18.837 --> 00:15:20.862
Have we still got a tail
on that Wilson kid?

00:15:20.872 --> 00:15:22.198
Yeah.

00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:23.198
The one who was
hanging out with Merrimen?

00:15:23.208 --> 00:15:24.832
What bar did he work in?

00:15:24.842 --> 00:15:27.837
- Hofbrau.
- Ziggy's Hofbrau.

00:15:27.847 --> 00:15:29.182
Let's pay him a visit.

00:15:39.558 --> 00:15:42.695
...some Wi-Fi? No?
We better check his videos.

00:15:45.697 --> 00:15:46.866
- Thanks.
- All right.

00:15:47.632 --> 00:15:49.525
Wolfgang, talk to me.

00:15:49.535 --> 00:15:51.559
- Donnie, I'm tapped out.
- No problem.

00:15:51.569 --> 00:15:53.194
Put it on my tab, all right?

00:15:53.204 --> 00:15:54.795
- Of course, man, I got you.
- Thank you.

00:15:54.805 --> 00:15:56.041
Have a good night.

00:16:08.219 --> 00:16:09.310
Are we doing this?

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.923
Yeah, man. All right, man.

00:16:11.722 --> 00:16:13.715
To money and women.

00:16:13.725 --> 00:16:14.928
That we don't have.

00:16:18.396 --> 00:16:20.755
How do you remember
everybody's order like that?

00:16:20.765 --> 00:16:23.358
I can't remember
the last four of my social.

00:16:23.368 --> 00:16:25.227
Lots of reps man.

00:16:25.237 --> 00:16:27.837
I'm in complete control of my environment.
People don't even know.

00:16:29.841 --> 00:16:31.400
- Hey, man, time to go.
- Okay.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.578
Wrap it up.

00:16:33.913 --> 00:16:36.105
- Just a little bit.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:16:36.115 --> 00:16:38.518
- Ziggy's going to kill me.
- Shit, not going to finish.

00:16:40.419 --> 00:16:41.588
A gift.

00:16:42.221 --> 00:16:43.511
How about a tip?

00:16:43.521 --> 00:16:45.246
We got you last time.

00:16:45.256 --> 00:16:46.748
Oh, yeah, you got me last...

00:16:46.758 --> 00:16:48.194
That's not how it works.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.800
Okay, really? Zoo animals.

00:17:00.271 --> 00:17:01.540
Need change?

00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:04.277
That's for you, <i>Fräulein.</i>

00:17:06.278 --> 00:17:07.579
Thanks.

00:17:08.947 --> 00:17:11.772
Are there always
so many cops in here?

00:17:11.782 --> 00:17:14.143
Last place
I'd think they'd be.

00:17:14.153 --> 00:17:17.212
Yeah, this their spot.
You know, cheap liquor.

00:17:17.222 --> 00:17:19.147
Right.

00:17:19.157 --> 00:17:22.161
Yeah, there also is a lot of
shady cats in here, huh?

00:17:23.728 --> 00:17:27.455
Yeah, it's kind of neutral
grounds, you know?

00:17:27.465 --> 00:17:29.801
Rick's in <i>Casablanca</i>
type shit.

00:17:31.802 --> 00:17:34.497
You must've heard
some stories in this place.

00:17:34.507 --> 00:17:37.966
You know, give him a couple of
drinks, steak on his plate,

00:17:37.976 --> 00:17:39.733
some nice women around him,

00:17:39.743 --> 00:17:41.447
he'll tell you
his darkest secrets.

00:17:42.646 --> 00:17:44.149
Loose lips sink ships.

00:17:44.849 --> 00:17:46.319
Ain't that the truth.

00:17:47.185 --> 00:17:49.422
Mmm, what about you?

00:17:51.655 --> 00:17:54.616
Pull a lot of pussy
in here? Yeah?

00:17:54.626 --> 00:17:55.683
Come on.

00:17:55.693 --> 00:17:57.497
- I do well for myself.
- Yeah.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:59.798
I'd fuck you.

00:18:02.666 --> 00:18:03.936
Kidding.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.275
All right.

00:18:12.344 --> 00:18:13.779
I'm out.

00:18:17.215 --> 00:18:19.008
See you later, man.

00:18:19.018 --> 00:18:20.386
Yeah.

00:18:21.786 --> 00:18:23.189
Look forward to it.

00:18:50.748 --> 00:18:52.886
- <i>Fräulein.</i>
- Dude, what the fuck are you...

00:19:11.403 --> 00:19:13.202
What the fuck?

00:19:32.924 --> 00:19:34.250
What's up, gangster?

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.350
Oh, Peaches.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.729
Oh, <i>Fräulein,</i> you're up.

00:19:40.232 --> 00:19:42.100
Sit down.
You sit right there.

00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:47.096
What you walking
so slow for, nigga?

00:19:47.106 --> 00:19:49.608
I want you to sit right there.
That's you right there.

00:19:52.478 --> 00:19:54.314
- Look here. There's cigarettes.
- Yeah.

00:19:56.281 --> 00:19:58.607
Borracho!

00:19:58.617 --> 00:20:00.786
I think y'all got me
confused with somebody.

00:20:07.225 --> 00:20:08.460
Why my pants wet?

00:20:11.129 --> 00:20:13.820
Come on, man, if you and
your Uncle Tom over here

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.924
are into some
homo shit, I'm good.

00:20:15.934 --> 00:20:17.270
Y'all just kill me now.

00:20:18.136 --> 00:20:19.606
You pissed yourself, bubba.

00:20:20.805 --> 00:20:22.630
It happens.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.968
I had one of the girls here
clean you up, so you're good.

00:20:25.978 --> 00:20:28.303
But y'all got the wrong dude.

00:20:28.313 --> 00:20:30.637
You got me confused
with someone.

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:33.142
But I'm going to let you know
now, I ain't the one.

00:20:33.152 --> 00:20:34.808
What'd you say?

00:20:34.818 --> 00:20:36.644
Dude something?

00:20:36.654 --> 00:20:39.657
No, we're not mistaking you for anybody.
Don't be a fucking smartass.

00:20:41.159 --> 00:20:43.817
Arrested at 17 for GTA.

00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:46.288
Tried and convicted
as an adult.

00:20:46.298 --> 00:20:47.654
We know exactly who you are.

00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:49.790
Did a stint at county
for attempted manslaughter.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.760
Fastest speeding ticket
in California history.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:53.928
That's nice.

00:20:53.938 --> 00:20:56.008
Fucking genius, man.
How fast were you going?

00:20:59.478 --> 00:21:00.776
178.

00:21:02.146 --> 00:21:03.883
Speed demon!

00:21:06.518 --> 00:21:08.176
What did you say to the cop
who pulled you over?

00:21:08.186 --> 00:21:09.346
What reason did you give him?

00:21:10.788 --> 00:21:13.222
Told him they'd
just paved the road.

00:21:14.393 --> 00:21:15.951
- I like him.
- Ballsy.

00:21:15.961 --> 00:21:17.353
<i>Me gusta.</i>

00:21:17.363 --> 00:21:19.555
You may have a little pecker
for a black dude.

00:21:19.565 --> 00:21:23.524
You may be a bed-wetter, but you've
got some fucking style, buddy.

00:21:23.534 --> 00:21:27.562
All right, girls, time to go.

00:21:27.572 --> 00:21:29.897
Grab your shoes. Grab your shit.
Let's go.

00:21:29.907 --> 00:21:31.232
Time to go home
to your babies.

00:21:31.242 --> 00:21:33.162
- All right, thanks for stopping by.
- Excuse me.

00:21:41.086 --> 00:21:44.312
You check this out, hot rod.
You're a two-striker.

00:21:44.322 --> 00:21:46.914
You need to fucking look at me
when I'm talking to you.

00:21:46.924 --> 00:21:51.552
You're one mistake away from getting
sex in the ass every time you shower.

00:21:51.562 --> 00:21:55.057
Some of them niggas
got gas pumps.

00:21:55.067 --> 00:21:59.927
Now, personally, that shit don't
sound like a lot of fun to me.

00:21:59.937 --> 00:22:01.907
What you think?
How you feel about that?

00:22:04.242 --> 00:22:07.336
Look, the dude in that picture
is not even a regular at my bar.

00:22:07.346 --> 00:22:12.015
Like, I've seen him a few times, but,
you know, I don't associate myself...

00:22:18.756 --> 00:22:20.093
Do you know what this means?

00:22:22.094 --> 00:22:24.453
It means I am
a member of a clique.

00:22:24.463 --> 00:22:26.454
It's kind of like
being in a gang.

00:22:26.464 --> 00:22:30.091
Sort of like a gang,
only we have badges,

00:22:30.101 --> 00:22:32.971
which means you are done.

00:22:34.272 --> 00:22:35.474
He ain't lying.

00:22:40.945 --> 00:22:42.437
Let me ask you this.

00:22:42.447 --> 00:22:45.640
Okay, do we look like the
types who will arrest you?

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.754
Put you in handcuffs,
drag you down to the station?

00:22:49.154 --> 00:22:51.245
Hmm?

00:22:51.255 --> 00:22:52.947
I'm asking you
a fucking question.

00:22:52.957 --> 00:22:54.982
No. Not at all.

00:22:54.992 --> 00:22:57.586
Right, exactly.

00:22:57.596 --> 00:23:00.967
We just shoot you.
It's less paperwork.

00:23:03.268 --> 00:23:04.604
So tell me,

00:23:07.805 --> 00:23:10.109
what the fuck are you doing
hanging out in that crew?

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.601
You're a pussy.

00:23:13.611 --> 00:23:15.802
Those dudes are bad dudes.

00:23:15.812 --> 00:23:19.907
Great thieves
but straight convicts.

00:23:19.917 --> 00:23:22.809
What's Merrimen doing drinking
beers with the likes of you for?

00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:23.979
Talk shop?

00:23:23.989 --> 00:23:25.947
You gonna hit
the fucking Hofbrau?

00:23:25.957 --> 00:23:29.017
Take the place down, score, like,
what, two grand in ones and fives?

00:23:29.027 --> 00:23:30.452
Is that what's afoot?
I'll answer that for you.

00:23:30.462 --> 00:23:32.131
No, it fucking isn't.

00:23:33.999 --> 00:23:36.524
I don't know what crew
you're speaking about, man.

00:23:36.534 --> 00:23:38.493
This dude just comes to
my bar where I work...

00:23:38.503 --> 00:23:41.807
Stop. Shut up.

00:23:48.812 --> 00:23:50.539
Come on, man. This is
some weird shit. Just...

00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:53.442
You listen to me, fuckface.

00:23:53.452 --> 00:23:55.184
We don't give
a shit about you.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:59.514
You in Merrimen's crew?

00:23:59.524 --> 00:24:00.626
Hmm?

00:24:01.692 --> 00:24:03.825
Huh? You hit the stadium?

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:07.321
You talky-talky now?

00:24:07.331 --> 00:24:08.699
Yes, please.

00:24:14.873 --> 00:24:15.908
Fuck!

00:24:23.882 --> 00:24:25.339
I'm just the driver!

00:24:25.349 --> 00:24:27.909
I'm just the driver!

00:24:27.919 --> 00:24:30.711
They don't give me no gun.
I don't do no gangster shit.

00:24:30.721 --> 00:24:33.080
They asked me to drive,
so that's what I do.

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.683
That's it. Fuck!

00:24:35.693 --> 00:24:38.587
Why did Merrimen hijack
an empty armored car?

00:24:38.597 --> 00:24:40.222
I don't know, all right?

00:24:40.232 --> 00:24:42.089
They keep me in the dark
for shit like this.

00:24:42.099 --> 00:24:43.357
If the cops come down on me,

00:24:43.367 --> 00:24:45.394
I can't tell them shit
if I don't know shit.

00:24:45.404 --> 00:24:47.694
Now y'all can hook me up
to a lie detector,

00:24:47.704 --> 00:24:49.932
a fucking polygraph,
whatever y'all got.

00:24:49.942 --> 00:24:53.001
I'm telling you what I know,
and that's all you'll get.

00:24:53.011 --> 00:24:54.914
Please, just let me
the fuck go.

00:24:57.081 --> 00:25:00.252
Fuck y'all, man.
Let me go.

00:25:02.087 --> 00:25:05.247
Well, I thought that was
relatively convincing, hmm?

00:25:05.257 --> 00:25:06.459
Good stuff.

00:25:08.426 --> 00:25:09.706
All right,
when did you meet him?

00:25:10.596 --> 00:25:12.220
What do I get out of this?

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:16.269
What do you get out of this?
Well, your freedom for one.

00:25:17.603 --> 00:25:18.971
Two,

00:25:21.472 --> 00:25:22.942
you're not the bad guys.

00:25:23.773 --> 00:25:24.944
We are.

00:25:30.482 --> 00:25:33.740
Couple months ago,
they came through the bar,

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.110
<i>and I served them
a few drinks.</i>

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.778
<i>We started talking.</i>

00:25:37.788 --> 00:25:39.615
This is my boy, Bosco.

00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:42.094
My brother for life.
We deployed together.

00:25:43.494 --> 00:25:45.263
Hey, the kid can drive.

00:25:46.797 --> 00:25:48.624
Okay.

00:25:48.634 --> 00:25:51.626
Donnie, tell him about
the Trans Am Series.

00:25:51.636 --> 00:25:54.806
Drove Trans Am Series, like
he said, for about a season.

00:25:55.507 --> 00:25:56.976
What were their names?

00:25:58.109 --> 00:25:59.810
Hawaiian dude,

00:26:00.979 --> 00:26:03.015
he had a homie,
Bosco, white boy.

00:26:04.682 --> 00:26:08.242
He was in the military,
and he worked for DWP.

00:26:08.252 --> 00:26:10.289
I told him I needed
some extra money,

00:26:11.188 --> 00:26:13.147
so he gave me a job.

00:26:13.157 --> 00:26:15.493
Who's that? Merrimen?

00:26:16.661 --> 00:26:18.130
Merrimen.

00:26:19.097 --> 00:26:20.997
<i>Ray Merrimen.</i>

00:26:28.838 --> 00:26:30.632
So what's up with this dude?

00:26:30.642 --> 00:26:31.876
It's Marcus' boy.

00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:36.837
Worked with him
over at the Hofbrau.

00:26:36.847 --> 00:26:39.473
Say he did some time
with him at Wayside.

00:26:39.483 --> 00:26:40.684
He was a Marine for a minute.

00:26:43.687 --> 00:26:45.823
Say the nigga can drive.
He be cool.

00:26:47.192 --> 00:26:50.896
All right,
let's check him out.

00:26:52.129 --> 00:26:54.522
<i>Real smart dude.</i>

00:26:54.532 --> 00:26:56.868
<i>He had just got out of prison
from what I could tell.</i>

00:27:03.207 --> 00:27:04.542
You ready to roll, Ray?

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.212
514!

00:27:13.385 --> 00:27:14.920
Come on, let's cuff them up.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:34.406
See you soon, Ray.

00:27:40.744 --> 00:27:41.903
No, you won't.

00:27:41.913 --> 00:27:43.538
<i>Where'd you meet him?</i>

00:27:43.548 --> 00:27:46.281
<i>It was in Carson,
at the Hawaiian dude's house.</i>

00:27:49.421 --> 00:27:51.579
- Donnie, what's good, man?
- What's up?

00:27:51.589 --> 00:27:53.358
- Come on, man. Follow me.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.262
Hey.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.588
Oh, shit. What's up?

00:28:00.598 --> 00:28:02.600
- Donnie, beer?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:28:03.733 --> 00:28:04.769
Thank you. Thank you.

00:28:13.778 --> 00:28:15.646
So you spent
some time at Wayside?

00:28:16.313 --> 00:28:17.748
Yeah, a little bit.

00:28:19.451 --> 00:28:21.620
What do they serve
for breakfast on Fridays?

00:28:27.158 --> 00:28:29.116
Silver dollar pancakes.

00:28:29.126 --> 00:28:30.296
Three of them.

00:28:32.463 --> 00:28:33.465
Where you from?

00:28:33.932 --> 00:28:35.000
Hawthorne.

00:28:36.967 --> 00:28:38.503
So you can drive, huh?

00:28:40.305 --> 00:28:41.637
Oh, I can drive.

00:28:47.945 --> 00:28:49.670
Drive.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.649
You might want to
put that seat belt on.

00:29:16.107 --> 00:29:17.276
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:29:35.026 --> 00:29:39.020
He liked how I drove, so, a
week later, I did my first gig.

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.032
<i>We hit this rave at a stadium.</i>

00:30:11.096 --> 00:30:12.364
Got one.

00:30:33.451 --> 00:30:35.954
Minus the dye pack,
is the count all good?

00:30:38.556 --> 00:30:40.092
The count is on.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:48.088
That's a lot of money
right there, bro.

00:30:48.098 --> 00:30:50.090
Why don't we
just call it a day?

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.960
Really?

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.395
You want three in hot bills,

00:30:54.405 --> 00:30:57.432
you looking over your shoulder
for the rest of your life,

00:30:57.442 --> 00:30:59.478
or would you rather
have 30 clean?

00:31:00.645 --> 00:31:02.080
I'm just saying.

00:31:03.814 --> 00:31:05.817
Let's just call it quits
while we're ahead.

00:31:08.586 --> 00:31:09.622
Put it away.

00:31:10.622 --> 00:31:11.924
We're trading up.

00:31:15.327 --> 00:31:18.297
All right. Fuck it.
Let's do it.

00:31:19.597 --> 00:31:21.322
What happened to the cash?

00:31:21.332 --> 00:31:22.666
I don't know.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.769
They don't tell me.

00:31:25.802 --> 00:31:27.305
They don't talk much.

00:31:29.807 --> 00:31:32.809
Yeah, people with things to
hide never have much to say.

00:31:35.613 --> 00:31:39.018
So am I under arrest,
or can I leave?

00:31:41.953 --> 00:31:44.412
Nah, you just keep
doing your thing.

00:31:44.422 --> 00:31:45.690
We'll be in touch.

00:32:03.174 --> 00:32:05.133
Yeah?

00:32:05.143 --> 00:32:08.314
<i>Horsepower, be at 1st and
Central at 0800. Don't be late.</i>

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.442
Jesus Christ!

00:33:44.975 --> 00:33:47.811
You scared the shit out of me,
babe. Can't do that.

00:33:48.646 --> 00:33:50.315
What are you doing right now?

00:33:55.652 --> 00:33:57.289
You erasing your recent calls?

00:34:00.492 --> 00:34:03.283
My phone? What do you mean?

00:34:03.293 --> 00:34:06.120
I don't know how to work this
fucking thing. You know that.

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:08.456
"I don't know how to work this
fucking thing. You know that."

00:34:08.466 --> 00:34:09.634
Come on.

00:34:11.635 --> 00:34:14.628
Babe, we really have
to go through this right now?

00:34:14.638 --> 00:34:15.672
Where you been?

00:34:18.977 --> 00:34:21.312
It's 6:00 a.m.
Where have you been?

00:34:22.513 --> 00:34:24.271
Been at work?

00:34:24.281 --> 00:34:28.143
Surveillance? Robbing drug dealers?
Because you smell like a stripper.

00:34:28.153 --> 00:34:29.654
Of course, I was at work.

00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:36.112
It's funny
'cause I got this text.

00:34:38.463 --> 00:34:39.831
What was so hot, then?

00:34:40.497 --> 00:34:41.867
Is that a work text?

00:34:42.766 --> 00:34:43.768
Huh?

00:34:48.339 --> 00:34:50.838
You fucked up.
You text me instead.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.013
Who does that?

00:35:01.019 --> 00:35:04.179
It's street theater, babe.
It's not what it looks like.

00:35:04.189 --> 00:35:05.223
I'm sorry.

00:35:06.156 --> 00:35:07.359
Me, too.

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.173
Fuck.

00:35:23.073 --> 00:35:24.565
We're going
to go to Auntie's house

00:35:24.575 --> 00:35:26.967
because Daddy's got to do
a little work on the house.

00:35:26.977 --> 00:35:28.402
And we have
something else to do.

00:35:28.412 --> 00:35:29.713
- Come on.
- What the fuck?

00:35:30.681 --> 00:35:32.340
Hey, yo.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.208
It's gonna be too loud
for you guys, okay?

00:35:34.218 --> 00:35:36.543
- Deb? Deb?
- Will you put this on?

00:35:36.553 --> 00:35:37.911
- Is Daddy coming with us?
- What are you doing, Deb?

00:35:37.921 --> 00:35:40.181
What the fuck are you doing?

00:35:40.191 --> 00:35:41.682
- It will be too loud for you guys.
- Wifey, wifey.

00:35:41.692 --> 00:35:43.227
Seriously,
what are you doing?

00:35:44.229 --> 00:35:45.685
Is Daddy coming with us?

00:35:45.695 --> 00:35:47.487
No, Daddy does not have
enough time for us right now.

00:35:47.497 --> 00:35:49.891
- Seriously... That's nice. That's nice.
- Can you put this on here?

00:35:49.901 --> 00:35:51.925
Hey, honey.
Mommy didn't mean that, okay?

00:35:51.935 --> 00:35:54.896
Hey, sweetie, come here.
Mommy didn't mean that, okay?

00:35:54.906 --> 00:35:58.210
She didn't mean that, okay?
Sweetie, you okay?

00:35:59.611 --> 00:36:00.934
Yeah, great. Great.

00:36:00.944 --> 00:36:03.237
Hey. Come here, honey.

00:36:03.247 --> 00:36:04.738
I'm not going to be able
to make it right now,

00:36:04.748 --> 00:36:06.907
but I'm gonna come
a little later, okay?

00:36:06.917 --> 00:36:08.409
All right. Come here.
Give me a hug.

00:36:08.419 --> 00:36:10.344
- Time to go right now.
- Christ sake.

00:36:10.354 --> 00:36:11.913
Will you slow it down
a second?

00:36:11.923 --> 00:36:13.280
Give Daddy some rest.
He's real tired.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.916
- Right, hon?
- What...

00:36:14.926 --> 00:36:18.130
Deb. Deb. Deb, will you
slow it down a second?

00:36:19.263 --> 00:36:20.754
- We're going to walk this way...
- Deb.

00:36:20.764 --> 00:36:23.023
Okay, watch your step.
Here we go.

00:36:23.033 --> 00:36:24.425
Deb, can you slow it...

00:36:24.435 --> 00:36:26.792
Okay. Come on.

00:36:26.802 --> 00:36:28.563
Let's go. We're going to
put your sister in first.

00:36:28.573 --> 00:36:30.898
Here we go. Okay, baby, ready?

00:36:30.908 --> 00:36:32.900
Sweetie, it's going to be
okay, sweetie. Okay?

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.767
Let's go.

00:36:34.777 --> 00:36:37.904
Okay, put your bags in there. You
wanna put your sister in the seat?

00:36:37.914 --> 00:36:38.983
Where's the pink bag?

00:36:40.118 --> 00:36:42.242
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

00:36:42.252 --> 00:36:44.311
Oh, great language right
in front of my daughter.

00:36:44.321 --> 00:36:45.745
Great fathering!

00:36:45.755 --> 00:36:47.614
Nice. Nice. Dropping F-bombs
in front of my daughters.

00:36:47.624 --> 00:36:50.585
- "My kids," huh? "My kids?"
- Great fathering!

00:36:50.595 --> 00:36:53.631
Gonna find a guy whose cock
actually gets hard for me.

00:36:54.966 --> 00:36:56.767
Deb, Deb, Deb. Stop!

00:36:57.668 --> 00:36:58.971
Please don't do this.

00:37:00.804 --> 00:37:02.341
Please.

00:37:14.952 --> 00:37:18.279
This is a little hard. You're just
scared right now, okay? You're confused.

00:37:18.289 --> 00:37:19.290
Okay...

00:37:22.359 --> 00:37:24.200
Out of the way, Nick.
Get out of the way, Nick.

00:37:26.363 --> 00:37:28.654
Get the fuck
out of here, you fucker!

00:37:28.664 --> 00:37:30.257
You motherfucker!

00:37:30.267 --> 00:37:34.370
You get back! You understand
me, you motherfucker?

00:37:35.506 --> 00:37:36.840
- Stay away from us!
- Nice. Nice.

00:37:37.607 --> 00:37:38.809
Good. Good.

00:37:46.049 --> 00:37:48.019
Okay. Mommy's okay.

00:37:57.394 --> 00:37:58.695
See you later.

00:38:04.868 --> 00:38:06.338
Perfect.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.209
Morning.

00:38:31.028 --> 00:38:33.687
Ran the prints on CAL-ID.

00:38:33.697 --> 00:38:36.090
Got a hit on our
dead guy from Angel City.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.692
- Check your e-mail.
- All right.

00:38:39.702 --> 00:38:42.763
Name's Marcus Rhodes,
from Oakland.

00:38:42.773 --> 00:38:45.698
ATF was looking for him
for gun charges.

00:38:45.708 --> 00:38:47.902
And more to the point
that you were making before,

00:38:47.912 --> 00:38:51.671
he was stationed at Twentynine Palms
the same time Merrimen was there.

00:38:51.681 --> 00:38:53.602
This is good.
Give me the book on Merrimen.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.556
Look to your right.

00:38:59.524 --> 00:39:01.081
You know what that is?

00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:03.617
It's the bank for banks.

00:39:03.627 --> 00:39:07.088
Los Angeles branch
of the Federal Reserve.

00:39:07.098 --> 00:39:09.234
It's the only bank
that's never been robbed.

00:39:16.973 --> 00:39:19.567
All the surrounding streets
are wired for sound and image.

00:39:19.577 --> 00:39:22.570
Stand across the street and stare
at the building for two minutes,

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.373
you'll have security on your ass
asking you politely to leave.

00:39:25.383 --> 00:39:27.275
If they see your face again,

00:39:27.285 --> 00:39:30.445
every Secret Service agent in the
country is going to be looking for you.

00:39:30.455 --> 00:39:31.456
The place is case-proof.

00:39:34.158 --> 00:39:38.085
There have been
53 break-in attempts.

00:39:38.095 --> 00:39:39.897
Not one has
got past the lobby.

00:39:43.301 --> 00:39:44.936
That's why
we're going to rob it.

00:39:45.635 --> 00:39:48.228
Okay, here we go.

00:39:48.238 --> 00:39:50.498
Laguna Niguel was in '06.

00:39:50.508 --> 00:39:54.101
Got caught for that, get sent
up to USP Victorville SHU

00:39:54.111 --> 00:39:56.971
until June of '16.
Now give me the unsolved book.

00:39:56.981 --> 00:39:59.005
<i>As soon as
you enter the lobby,</i>

00:39:59.015 --> 00:40:01.608
<i>computers run you through every law
enforcement database in the country.</i>

00:40:01.618 --> 00:40:03.776
If you've got outstanding
parking tickets,

00:40:03.786 --> 00:40:06.645
they're going to know about it before you
get through the first level of security.

00:40:06.655 --> 00:40:09.083
All the employees wear
security swipe cards

00:40:09.093 --> 00:40:11.318
that grant them access through
the first set of man-traps.

00:40:11.328 --> 00:40:14.322
<i>Access is severely restricted.</i>

00:40:14.332 --> 00:40:16.590
<i>Two stories below street level
is the vault floor.</i>

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.802
By the way,

00:40:18.502 --> 00:40:20.494
uh, his crimey...

00:40:20.504 --> 00:40:21.606
- Levoux?
- Levoux.

00:40:22.272 --> 00:40:24.197
He serve with Merrimen?

00:40:24.207 --> 00:40:27.467
Not only that, but they played football
in high school at Long Beach Poly.

00:40:27.477 --> 00:40:29.871
- You've got to be shitting me.
- No.

00:40:29.881 --> 00:40:33.440
<i>Central Security, it's
the nerve center for the Fed.</i>

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:37.344
<i>This is where the armored cars
come in, drop off the money tubs.</i>

00:40:37.354 --> 00:40:39.547
<i>Money tubs are handed off
to the Fed employees.</i>

00:40:39.557 --> 00:40:45.152
<i>At any one time, there's anywhere between
500 and 800 billion dollars in there,</i>

00:40:45.162 --> 00:40:48.787
<i>every millimeter of it covered by
cameras, sensors, and motion detectors.</i>

00:40:48.797 --> 00:40:50.491
Yeah. What did they
specialize in?

00:40:50.501 --> 00:40:54.128
I got this from the HR desk
at Twentynine Palms.

00:40:54.138 --> 00:40:57.731
Close Quarter Battle Unit. Both
saw combat in the Middle East.

00:40:57.741 --> 00:41:02.168
Levoux specializes in explosives, where
Merrimen specializes in soldiering,

00:41:02.178 --> 00:41:05.038
both MARSOC fast Marines.

00:41:05.048 --> 00:41:06.873
But there's a hitch.

00:41:06.883 --> 00:41:10.177
The serial number of every bill is
recorded in the Fed's database.

00:41:10.187 --> 00:41:11.579
<i>So, if a note goes missing,</i>

00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:13.079
<i>they're going to know
exactly which one it is.</i>

00:41:13.089 --> 00:41:15.814
They're going to flag it.
If that bill comes up again,

00:41:15.824 --> 00:41:18.817
whoever recirculates that cash, no
matter where they are in the world,

00:41:18.827 --> 00:41:20.054
that person can be tracked.

00:41:20.064 --> 00:41:22.355
Okay. Bosco,
the peckerwood?

00:41:22.365 --> 00:41:25.525
He's a Huntington Beach kid,
also MARSOC Marines.

00:41:25.535 --> 00:41:28.228
He did comms with them.
He had a solid career.

00:41:28.238 --> 00:41:30.364
But he didn't serve together
with the other guys.

00:41:30.374 --> 00:41:33.000
He was the Wood Rep at Victorville
when Merrimen was there.

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:35.001
That's where they linked up.

00:41:35.011 --> 00:41:38.738
Donnie was a Marine for a
year and a half, then discharged.

00:41:38.748 --> 00:41:40.440
So, the way I see it,

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:42.208
that's the way all these niggas
ended up working together.

00:41:42.218 --> 00:41:45.445
There's only two passports on the
streets, sports and military.

00:41:45.455 --> 00:41:48.215
Every time the Fed receives
a deposit from a bank,

00:41:48.225 --> 00:41:51.117
<i>first thing they do is send that
money up to the count rooms.</i>

00:41:51.127 --> 00:41:53.454
<i>They run the notes
through the counting machines.</i>

00:41:53.464 --> 00:41:55.221
<i>They're accomplishing
two things here.</i>

00:41:55.231 --> 00:41:57.790
<i>First, they're double-checking the
accuracy of the bank's deposit.</i>

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.360
<i>If the bank is off at all,</i>

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:01.195
they're going to credit or
debit the account accordingly.

00:42:01.205 --> 00:42:06.933
Two, they're separating newer, fit
currency from old unfit bills.

00:42:06.943 --> 00:42:09.570
But most importantly, they're
erasing the serial numbers

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.871
of the old bills
from the Fed system.

00:42:11.881 --> 00:42:15.774
Once those numbers are erased, to
the Fed, to the rest of the world,

00:42:15.784 --> 00:42:18.079
that money
has ceased to exist.

00:42:18.089 --> 00:42:19.645
Wait, let's look at
the unsolved cases.

00:42:19.655 --> 00:42:24.050
In '04, you have the Boller
National Bank Hollywood job, okay?

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.752
They tunneled through
the sewer system.

00:42:25.762 --> 00:42:29.823
Sophisticated, skill set,
someone with access, unsolved.

00:42:29.833 --> 00:42:33.494
Okay, in '05, you have the
Fuerte armored car depot job.

00:42:33.504 --> 00:42:35.596
Blew the depot vault
with shaped charges.

00:42:35.606 --> 00:42:37.565
In the $100 count room alone,

00:42:37.575 --> 00:42:42.235
an average of $30 million is
designated as unfit every day.

00:42:42.245 --> 00:42:43.736
Between 4:00 p.m.
and 5:00 p.m.,

00:42:43.746 --> 00:42:46.083
<i>all the cash gets shot out
to the shredder.</i>

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:47.953
It's all destroyed.

00:42:49.319 --> 00:42:55.181
$30 million
turned to dust in seconds.

00:42:55.191 --> 00:42:57.485
It's then picked up by the
Fed's waste management company

00:42:57.495 --> 00:42:58.863
and brought out to the dump.

00:43:00.531 --> 00:43:02.523
If we can get to
those unfit bills

00:43:02.533 --> 00:43:05.825
before they go to the shredders
and get out clean...

00:43:05.835 --> 00:43:08.596
You got $30 million
nobody is looking for.

00:43:08.606 --> 00:43:09.796
Bingo.

00:43:09.806 --> 00:43:12.166
In '06,
you have Laguna Niguel.

00:43:12.176 --> 00:43:15.834
Same thing, only this time Merrimen
gets unlucky with the tail-light.

00:43:15.844 --> 00:43:20.840
Goes to prison till 2016. Now in
that time, while he was in prison,

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:23.943
how many highly sophisticated,
well-executed heists do we have?

00:43:23.953 --> 00:43:25.678
None, but you're
on a roll. Keep going.

00:43:25.688 --> 00:43:29.617
The counter guy at the donut shop?
Witness to the whole thing.

00:43:29.627 --> 00:43:30.694
They left him. Why?

00:43:33.564 --> 00:43:37.157
Because they shoot uniforms,
not unarmed civilians.

00:43:37.167 --> 00:43:38.903
Exactly what
they were trained to do.

00:43:39.802 --> 00:43:41.472
Gangbangers, these are not.

00:43:42.406 --> 00:43:46.900
Okay, these are our guys.

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:50.881
We nail these guys,
we solve all these cases.

00:43:51.648 --> 00:43:53.852
This is the crew.

00:43:55.885 --> 00:43:58.589
You still haven't told us how
you can get past that security.

00:44:00.091 --> 00:44:01.893
We're not going in this way.

00:44:04.428 --> 00:44:06.097
We're going in that way.

00:44:16.073 --> 00:44:17.864
What's going on
with <i>Fräulein?</i>

00:44:17.874 --> 00:44:19.776
We can move on him
anytime we want.

00:44:21.777 --> 00:44:23.703
- I pay minimum wage.
- Okay.

00:44:23.713 --> 00:44:27.074
Plus $3 for delivery.
And you split the tip with me.

00:44:27.084 --> 00:44:29.210
You start Wednesday, 11:00.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:30.945
Thank you.

00:44:30.955 --> 00:44:32.913
I don't really like the
food there, but I'm down to go,

00:44:32.923 --> 00:44:35.014
- but you've got to pay this time.
- I'm not paying it.

00:44:35.024 --> 00:44:36.449
What?

00:44:36.459 --> 00:44:39.119
- I pay every fucking time.
- What?

00:44:39.129 --> 00:44:40.454
Get off your wallet, buddy.

00:44:40.464 --> 00:44:42.123
No, I forgot my wallet today,
boys. I'm sorry.

00:44:42.133 --> 00:44:43.891
- Again?
- Yeah, again.

00:44:43.901 --> 00:44:45.192
Got an alligator arm.

00:44:45.202 --> 00:44:48.561
I sat down at blackjack
with $5, and I made $160.

00:44:48.571 --> 00:44:50.207
Nicholas O'Brien?

00:44:51.775 --> 00:44:53.233
Yeah?

00:44:53.243 --> 00:44:55.245
I suggest you take these.

00:44:56.546 --> 00:44:57.814
You're being served.

00:44:58.948 --> 00:45:00.273
You kidding me?

00:45:00.283 --> 00:45:01.618
I'm afraid not.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:04.923
What's going on?

00:45:06.055 --> 00:45:08.114
You all right, bro?

00:45:08.124 --> 00:45:09.593
Yeah, I guess
I'm getting divorced.

00:45:10.793 --> 00:45:12.229
He say "divorced"?

00:45:13.997 --> 00:45:15.265
Yo.

00:45:16.966 --> 00:45:18.958
Welcome to the fucking club.

00:45:18.968 --> 00:45:20.803
Now, go handle your business,
big man.

00:45:39.289 --> 00:45:41.849
There's a closer view.

00:45:41.859 --> 00:45:44.518
There was a rolling blackout in
this quadrant four days ago.

00:45:44.528 --> 00:45:46.453
Yeah, they've been happening a
lot over the last few months.

00:45:46.463 --> 00:45:48.154
Okay.

00:45:48.164 --> 00:45:50.590
They say they have full backup
power, but actually they don't.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.792
- They go into brown-out.
- Yeah, prioritize the grid.

00:45:53.802 --> 00:45:56.830
Priority, of course, is the vault.
So everything in there stays intact.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.500
But anything that is peripheral,
like cameras in the hallway,

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:02.669
shredders in the count rooms,
everything else cuts out.

00:46:02.679 --> 00:46:06.206
To time it during another rolling blackout
is going to be fucking impossible.

00:46:06.216 --> 00:46:09.009
- So you want to simulate it?
- Can we?

00:46:09.019 --> 00:46:11.045
Break in, have them go brown
for about two minutes.

00:46:11.055 --> 00:46:14.215
I'd say yes, but I'd like
to have data to be sure.

00:46:14.225 --> 00:46:15.781
Great.

00:46:15.791 --> 00:46:18.184
Once we breach the count room,
only thing left is the cameras.

00:46:18.194 --> 00:46:20.020
They run on their
own power supply,

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:22.623
so they're unaffected
by the brown-out.

00:46:22.633 --> 00:46:26.226
The solve here is
we run an EMP burst.

00:46:26.236 --> 00:46:29.662
Should take out the cameras
and motion for about 30 feet.

00:46:29.672 --> 00:46:31.708
Where you get all this
information from?

00:46:33.544 --> 00:46:35.702
You don't have to
worry about that.

00:46:35.712 --> 00:46:37.415
Just trust me
when I say it's solid.

00:46:39.082 --> 00:46:40.875
How we doing
with the Telecal hook?

00:46:40.885 --> 00:46:43.254
Couple days.
Shouldn't be a problem.

00:46:45.522 --> 00:46:47.403
<i>How many handlers do you need?</i>

00:46:53.196 --> 00:46:54.636
<i>Uh, gate B right now.</i>

00:46:56.699 --> 00:46:59.404
Strolling right into
the Federal Reserve.

00:47:05.441 --> 00:47:07.377
<i>Force leaving loading dock B.</i>

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:21.292

00:47:29.533 --> 00:47:30.734
Sign in, please.

00:47:41.044 --> 00:47:42.801
Keep this on you
at all times.

00:47:42.811 --> 00:47:45.582
Second bay of elevators.
Cafeteria's level 2.

00:47:49.319 --> 00:47:50.588
Buzz him in. He's good.

00:47:52.122 --> 00:47:53.625
Smells good.

00:47:55.059 --> 00:47:56.294
He's good. Let him in.

00:48:15.946 --> 00:48:18.638
- Sharon?
- Mmm-hmm. That's me.

00:48:18.648 --> 00:48:21.141
- How you all doing?
- Good. How you are doing today?

00:48:21.151 --> 00:48:23.588
- He's fine.
- Thank you.

00:48:24.321 --> 00:48:25.778
She ain't getting none.

00:48:25.788 --> 00:48:28.181
Shut up. Really?

00:48:28.191 --> 00:48:30.516
Y'all have a good day.
I'm gonna stay out of it.

00:48:30.526 --> 00:48:32.785
- We will now.
- You have a wonderful day.

00:48:32.795 --> 00:48:36.155
Lunch. Dessert.
Lunch. Dessert.

00:48:36.165 --> 00:48:37.167
Bye, sunshine.

00:49:09.466 --> 00:49:10.568
There he goes.

00:49:21.979 --> 00:49:24.015
My gosh.

00:49:24.881 --> 00:49:26.216
Aw!

00:49:35.859 --> 00:49:36.861
- Oh, he's here.
- Okay.

00:49:45.202 --> 00:49:47.927
Damn, girl looking fine.

00:49:47.937 --> 00:49:50.431
Thank you.
You look amazing.

00:49:50.441 --> 00:49:52.565
How are you?

00:49:52.575 --> 00:49:54.400
- Looking good.
- Thank you.

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:56.436
- This is my mom. This is Rolando.
- Hi.

00:49:56.446 --> 00:49:59.005
- Nice to meet you. Rolando.
- Hi, I'm Malia. Nice to meet you.

00:49:59.015 --> 00:50:01.415
- I see where you get your looks from.
- Thank you.

00:50:03.921 --> 00:50:05.112
Thank you.

00:50:05.122 --> 00:50:06.957
- Can I take that?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

00:50:08.591 --> 00:50:11.284
Um, Rolando,
this is my dad.

00:50:11.294 --> 00:50:14.598
What's up, Mr. Levoux?
Nice to meet you.

00:50:17.434 --> 00:50:19.802
Let me holler at him
for a second.

00:50:22.039 --> 00:50:23.473
Let me talk to you, bruh.

00:50:31.548 --> 00:50:34.618
Honey, don't worry about it.
Okay? They're just gonna talk.

00:50:42.757 --> 00:50:44.418
So here's what's up.

00:50:44.428 --> 00:50:46.386
For the past 16 years,

00:50:46.396 --> 00:50:49.056
my daughter's safety and protection
has been my responsibility

00:50:49.066 --> 00:50:51.257
and my responsibility only.

00:50:51.267 --> 00:50:55.472
Now, for the first time in her life, I see
I've got to hand you that responsibility.

00:50:56.606 --> 00:50:57.931
Don't fuck up,

00:50:57.941 --> 00:50:59.632
or your mama
will weep as she has

00:50:59.642 --> 00:51:02.579
to wheel your ass around every
day the rest of your life.

00:51:05.348 --> 00:51:09.308
Now I worked on this, because I want to
say this to you as nice as possible.

00:51:09.318 --> 00:51:10.810
Do you understand?

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.154
Yeah. Yes, sir.

00:51:18.495 --> 00:51:20.454
It's all right.
It's all right.

00:51:20.464 --> 00:51:22.322
Listen. Listen.

00:51:22.332 --> 00:51:24.925
All he's trying to say is,
it's wonderful to meet you,

00:51:24.935 --> 00:51:27.004
and he wants you
to have a beautiful evening.

00:51:28.704 --> 00:51:30.274
I'll see you at 11:30.

00:51:31.008 --> 00:51:32.498
Yeah. Yeah.

00:51:32.508 --> 00:51:35.278
- 11:30. Yeah. 11:30.
- Good choice.

00:51:43.019 --> 00:51:44.687
I think he got
the picture, bro.

00:51:49.859 --> 00:51:50.861
Psst.

00:52:23.392 --> 00:52:25.152
Beers and sake,
let's go.

00:52:25.162 --> 00:52:27.598
- Have wine.
- What the fuck?

00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:02.731
Hey.

00:53:03.733 --> 00:53:04.768
Buddy.

00:53:06.701 --> 00:53:08.027
Donnie, right?

00:53:08.037 --> 00:53:09.929
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:53:09.939 --> 00:53:11.796
Yeah, spotted you at the gym
the other day, yeah?

00:53:11.806 --> 00:53:13.400
Yeah, man. How you doing?

00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:14.979
What's up, fellows?

00:53:18.247 --> 00:53:19.715
You play football
at Long Beach Poly?

00:53:20.417 --> 00:53:21.552
You look familiar.

00:53:22.618 --> 00:53:24.222
No, I'm not from around here.

00:53:27.223 --> 00:53:29.459
What are you doing here?
You work around here?

00:53:31.394 --> 00:53:33.552
Enjoying my dinner, man.

00:53:33.562 --> 00:53:34.920
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:35.932
Food here sucks.

00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:41.771
Yeah. Yeah,
we come here for the ass.

00:53:47.144 --> 00:53:48.646
So I'll see ya
at the gym, man.

00:53:53.249 --> 00:53:56.242
Yeah. Definitely.

00:53:56.252 --> 00:53:57.622
Have a good night.

00:54:04.759 --> 00:54:08.288
Number 55, right?
That's how I remember you.

00:54:08.298 --> 00:54:10.434
We wore the same
number, 55, right?

00:54:11.167 --> 00:54:12.691
I went to South Torrance.

00:54:12.701 --> 00:54:15.594
Yeah, we played you guys
a couple of times.

00:54:15.604 --> 00:54:18.264
You and all those
fat-ass Samoans.

00:54:18.274 --> 00:54:21.667
Yeah, they were big,
but, man, lazy motherfuckers.

00:54:21.677 --> 00:54:23.114
Probably all that Spam.

00:54:25.015 --> 00:54:27.039
Yeah, we fucking
crushed you guys.

00:54:27.049 --> 00:54:30.053
Crushed you guys when I was there.
Crushed you guys when you were there.

00:54:30.854 --> 00:54:32.323
Still crushing you guys.

00:54:34.624 --> 00:54:36.949
We've got family here, bro.

00:54:36.959 --> 00:54:38.617
Don't really appreciate
you popping off.

00:54:38.627 --> 00:54:41.855
All right. All right, man.
No need to get all agro.

00:54:41.865 --> 00:54:44.668
Was I being rude?
Was I being rude?

00:54:46.068 --> 00:54:48.161
- What?
- Let's go order, bro.

00:54:48.171 --> 00:54:49.996
Hey, look, man, listen.

00:54:50.006 --> 00:54:53.511
You've got a beautiful family.
Everything's all good. Excuse us.

00:54:56.879 --> 00:54:58.048
<i>Kampai.</i>

00:54:59.482 --> 00:55:00.885
See you at the gym, Donnie.

00:55:02.252 --> 00:55:03.653
Have a good night, ladies.

00:55:31.881 --> 00:55:32.950
You a cop?

00:55:34.717 --> 00:55:36.921
No. Are you?

00:55:45.728 --> 00:55:46.796
Get out of the car.

00:55:55.771 --> 00:55:56.773
Go!

00:56:16.791 --> 00:56:18.050
- Where's the wire?
- Come on, man.

00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:19.795
I'm not wearing
a fucking wire, man.

00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:23.897
Man, I'm not wearing
no fucking wire.

00:56:28.838 --> 00:56:29.974
Get up.

00:56:39.482 --> 00:56:41.574
How does he know you?

00:56:41.584 --> 00:56:43.420
Don't tell me
it's from the fucking gym.

00:56:45.021 --> 00:56:46.980
Look, I don't know him.

00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.992
Smoke this punk.

00:56:52.028 --> 00:56:54.787
Talk, motherfucker.

00:56:54.797 --> 00:56:56.956
I'm not no cop, all right?

00:56:56.966 --> 00:56:58.858
Now he came to me.
He know you.

00:56:58.868 --> 00:57:01.827
He know all of you.
But I ain't tell him shit.

00:57:01.837 --> 00:57:03.429
He was sweating me.
I ain't seen him since.

00:57:03.439 --> 00:57:05.008
I thought he'd leave us alone.

00:57:13.182 --> 00:57:14.650
So how much do they know?

00:57:16.486 --> 00:57:17.488
Nothing.

00:57:18.721 --> 00:57:20.480
I ain't tell them shit.

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:23.016
I don't know nothing anyway.

00:57:23.026 --> 00:57:25.863
And you know I'm the last
person that would fuck this up.

00:57:27.964 --> 00:57:30.034
Now, if we've got to
call it off, I get it.

00:57:31.167 --> 00:57:32.870
But I know
I ain't tell them shit.

00:57:56.493 --> 00:57:59.563
Friday. Make sure
he knows it's on.

00:58:27.057 --> 00:58:29.081
So good.

00:58:29.091 --> 00:58:31.928
It's true, though. It's true.

00:58:32.562 --> 00:58:33.964
Okay.

00:58:34.531 --> 00:58:35.698
Okay.

00:58:45.542 --> 00:58:46.967
How you doing, Nick?

00:58:46.977 --> 00:58:48.212
Hmm.

00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:52.105
- I'm Nick.
- Hello.

00:58:52.115 --> 00:58:54.285
- How are you?
- Good.

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:00.413
What's for...

00:59:00.423 --> 00:59:02.916
- What's for dinner?
- You smell like alcohol, Nick.

00:59:02.926 --> 00:59:04.128
Hmm?

00:59:07.795 --> 00:59:08.898
Relax.

00:59:09.797 --> 00:59:11.767
I already ate.

00:59:18.475 --> 00:59:20.467
Give me a pen, stud.

00:59:20.477 --> 00:59:22.636
Nick, I was gonna call you.

00:59:22.646 --> 00:59:24.170
I was gonna take you
to dinner next week.

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:26.183
Just give me a fucking pen.

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:45.535
Thanks, Rudd.

00:59:47.802 --> 00:59:50.540
- I'm gonna hit the...
- No, you're not.

00:59:57.446 --> 00:59:58.948
How's the wine?

01:00:01.484 --> 01:00:02.818
Good?

01:00:06.555 --> 01:00:08.690
That's pretty fucking good.

01:00:10.392 --> 01:00:12.184
So I imagine
I just, uh...

01:00:12.194 --> 01:00:16.033
What, just sign
anywhere, yeah?

01:00:16.699 --> 01:00:18.324
Okay.

01:00:18.334 --> 01:00:21.895
And I imagine it's assumed
that if you were ever

01:00:21.905 --> 01:00:25.830
to touch one of my girls
or, say, talk to them

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.710
or, you know,
even look at them,

01:00:29.178 --> 01:00:32.371
I go boom-boom. You
know what I'm saying?

01:00:32.381 --> 01:00:33.873
But, I mean, that's
self-evident, right?

01:00:33.883 --> 01:00:36.709
There's no need to put that
in the contract, is there?

01:00:36.719 --> 01:00:38.040
- No, I didn't think so.
- Nick...

01:00:43.225 --> 01:00:45.528
Can you please go, Nick?

01:00:46.562 --> 01:00:48.697
- That's enough, Nick.
- Sure.

01:00:53.701 --> 01:00:54.736
Come on.

01:00:56.272 --> 01:00:58.731
Come here. Give me a hug.

01:00:58.741 --> 01:01:01.245
Come on. We'll save
a fortune in therapy.

01:01:04.414 --> 01:01:05.415
Hmm?

01:01:06.915 --> 01:01:08.051
Come on. Give me a hug.

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.878
There you go, huh, hoss?

01:01:12.888 --> 01:01:15.781
You've just always got to make
a spectacle out of everything.

01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:17.583
There you go.

01:01:17.593 --> 01:01:19.062
Yeah, pretty much.

01:01:20.263 --> 01:01:22.798
All right, Nick.
I think it's time to go.

01:01:24.033 --> 01:01:25.301
Come on, Nick, let's go.

01:01:28.737 --> 01:01:30.929
Call the fucking cops.
That's what I'm saying.

01:01:30.939 --> 01:01:33.433
- Call the fucking cops.
- I'm sorry, but it's time for you to go.

01:01:33.443 --> 01:01:34.767
Call the cops.

01:01:34.777 --> 01:01:37.402
- I'm sorry...
- Don't fucking touch me.

01:01:37.412 --> 01:01:40.038
- I'm sorry.
- Do not fucking touch me.

01:01:40.048 --> 01:01:42.085
- Come on, Nick.
- Just, please go.

01:01:56.298 --> 01:01:58.001
Take your time.

01:02:05.073 --> 01:02:07.844
What happened to you?

01:02:15.984 --> 01:02:17.954
Borracho, what do you think?

01:02:19.022 --> 01:02:20.980
What the fuck was that?

01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:22.282
You spotted me at the gym?

01:02:22.292 --> 01:02:23.927
<i>Tranquillo.</i> All right?

01:02:26.328 --> 01:02:27.997
Sit down.

01:02:31.334 --> 01:02:33.326
I'll take it, Freddy.

01:02:33.336 --> 01:02:35.606
Just give us a minute, okay?

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.676
Look, they're not going to off
you with this much heat, okay?

01:02:43.345 --> 01:02:44.813
When's this happening?

01:02:45.281 --> 01:02:46.517
Friday.

01:02:47.482 --> 01:02:49.275
Where?

01:02:49.285 --> 01:02:51.488
I don't know yet.
All I can tell you is Friday.

01:02:52.187 --> 01:02:53.846
TGIF, huh?

01:02:53.856 --> 01:02:55.625
You're protecting me on this.

01:02:56.225 --> 01:02:57.461
<i>Fräulein,</i>

01:02:59.194 --> 01:03:00.330
we got your back, bro.

01:03:01.497 --> 01:03:03.167
Don't worry about a thing.

01:03:05.701 --> 01:03:06.904
Fuck.

01:03:09.339 --> 01:03:11.174
Better wear your vest.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.343
We're in.

01:08:33.062 --> 01:08:35.855
Z?

01:08:35.865 --> 01:08:38.557
Pico Rivera Savings,
Montebello Town Center.

01:08:38.567 --> 01:08:40.325
<i>Copy that, boss.
See you at 0800.</i>

01:08:40.335 --> 01:08:41.669
Tell the crew.

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:48.843
I did what you told me to.

01:10:46.429 --> 01:10:47.931
There you go.
Good job there.

01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:56.704
McKenna!

01:11:04.347 --> 01:11:08.040
Hey, sweetie. Hey, sweetie.

01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:11.110
How are you? Good?

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.289
What are you doing?

01:11:13.488 --> 01:11:16.147
Well, you know,
I was on my way to work

01:11:16.157 --> 01:11:19.852
and thought I'd come by and say
hello to my little monkey.

01:11:19.862 --> 01:11:21.720
Is that okay?

01:11:21.730 --> 01:11:23.888
How's everything
at school? Okay?

01:11:23.898 --> 01:11:25.733
- Yes, it's good.
- Yeah?

01:11:27.135 --> 01:11:29.562
And what about Auntie's house?

01:11:29.572 --> 01:11:31.374
Mommy and Cassady,
are they good?

01:11:37.979 --> 01:11:39.871
What about the honey-bear?
Honey-bear good?

01:11:39.881 --> 01:11:42.051
Yeah? You miss me?

01:11:47.089 --> 01:11:50.148
All right, Pookie,
better get back to class.

01:11:50.158 --> 01:11:52.151
When am I going
to see you again?

01:11:52.161 --> 01:11:55.831
Soon, sweetheart.
I'm gonna see you soon.

01:11:57.665 --> 01:11:59.502
I want to come home.

01:12:02.371 --> 01:12:03.706
Me, too.

01:12:05.241 --> 01:12:07.944
All right, you better
get back to class, okay?

01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:10.347
But I'm gonna see you later.

01:12:11.246 --> 01:12:12.381
Promise?

01:12:15.084 --> 01:12:16.719
I promise.

01:12:18.786 --> 01:12:20.622
Come on.

01:12:23.758 --> 01:12:27.263
Recess is over.
Come on, kids. Come line up.

01:12:28.464 --> 01:12:30.066
Go on, Pookie.

01:12:30.732 --> 01:12:32.124
Bye, Daddy.

01:12:32.134 --> 01:12:33.470
Come on, McKenna.

01:12:35.736 --> 01:12:37.272
Come on, honey.

01:13:52.348 --> 01:13:53.950
Jock up.

01:14:01.822 --> 01:14:03.326
Tac up, brother.

01:14:06.528 --> 01:14:08.553
No Fed?

01:14:08.563 --> 01:14:10.232
Change of plans.

01:14:11.901 --> 01:14:13.959
Pay attention.

01:14:13.969 --> 01:14:17.009
Always keep your finger off the trigger
until you're going to shoot somebody.

01:14:17.406 --> 01:14:20.698
If and when that happens,
safety selector switch.

01:14:20.708 --> 01:14:22.545
One for semi,
two for full auto.

01:14:41.829 --> 01:14:43.254
Mag release.

01:14:43.264 --> 01:14:45.356
Out with the old,
in with the new.

01:14:45.366 --> 01:14:47.593
Tug it. Make sure
it's in there good.

01:14:47.603 --> 01:14:50.195
Slap the bolt home,
you're ready for round two.

01:14:50.205 --> 01:14:53.264
Other than that, keep this thing
pointed at the fucking floor.

01:14:53.274 --> 01:14:54.611
- You understand?
- Got it.

01:14:56.344 --> 01:14:57.347
Go put your shit on.

01:15:19.033 --> 01:15:21.437
- Magazine, Borracho?
- Yeah.

01:15:52.666 --> 01:15:54.803
- We good?
- We good.

01:16:31.005 --> 01:16:33.031
Suspects arriving on location.

01:16:33.041 --> 01:16:35.299
We've got nothing for the DA. They
haven't committed a crime yet.

01:16:35.309 --> 01:16:37.436
<i>They clear the bank,
we take them down.</i>

01:16:37.446 --> 01:16:39.048
- <i>Stand by.</i>
- Roger that.

01:16:49.625 --> 01:16:51.482
Broad fucking daylight.

01:16:51.492 --> 01:16:52.693
They're packing big.

01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:58.666
Ooh, shit. Look at these
motherfuckers.

01:17:03.871 --> 01:17:06.031
Get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground!

01:17:06.041 --> 01:17:08.499
Down on the ground! Get
down on the fucking ground!

01:17:08.509 --> 01:17:09.567
Freeze!

01:17:09.577 --> 01:17:11.169
Freeze! Don't move!
Stay right there!

01:17:11.179 --> 01:17:12.214
Freeze!

01:17:13.081 --> 01:17:14.406
Freeze!

01:17:14.416 --> 01:17:16.340
- You two! Move! Get over there!
- Get over here!

01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:18.220
Hurry up!

01:17:20.089 --> 01:17:21.914
Get out here, now!

01:17:21.924 --> 01:17:25.228
Move there now! Go! Go! Go!

01:17:26.394 --> 01:17:29.197
Move back!
Stay right there! Now!

01:17:30.432 --> 01:17:32.201
Eyes to the floor!

01:17:35.237 --> 01:17:36.861
Listen up!

01:17:36.871 --> 01:17:38.996
Everybody pay the fuck
attention!

01:17:39.006 --> 01:17:40.432
Eyes to the ground!

01:17:40.442 --> 01:17:42.667
'Cause I'm only
going to say this once!

01:17:42.677 --> 01:17:45.838
If you cooperate,
if you follow directions,

01:17:45.848 --> 01:17:49.907
you will not be hurt. We are
here for money, not for you.

01:17:49.917 --> 01:17:52.009
I want everybody lined up
on the counter. Let's go!

01:17:52.019 --> 01:17:53.289
Move down!

01:17:54.022 --> 01:17:55.547
Move down! Let's go!

01:17:55.557 --> 01:17:58.416
Everybody behind the counter,
come out front! Let's go!

01:17:58.426 --> 01:18:01.229
Keep your eyes down
and your mouths shut.

01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:04.123
On my command,

01:18:04.133 --> 01:18:08.227
reach inside your pockets,
remove your cell phones,

01:18:08.237 --> 01:18:10.963
and put your hands in the air.

01:18:10.973 --> 01:18:13.475
Everybody take
two steps forward.

01:18:15.210 --> 01:18:17.146
Now go down on your knees.

01:18:20.048 --> 01:18:21.983
All right! Cell phones
right in here.

01:18:22.384 --> 01:18:23.541
On me.

01:18:23.551 --> 01:18:24.775
Let's go.
Put them in the box.

01:18:24.785 --> 01:18:25.987
Tie them up.

01:18:28.557 --> 01:18:30.615
Go! Go! Go!

01:18:30.625 --> 01:18:32.784
There will be
no heroics today.

01:18:32.794 --> 01:18:35.320
You guys go ahead
and get comfortable.

01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:37.255
We're going to
be here for a while.

01:18:37.265 --> 01:18:39.434
Anybody need to
use the bathroom?

01:18:40.602 --> 01:18:42.138
Take a piss on yourself.

01:18:50.612 --> 01:18:51.646
Hey.

01:18:58.152 --> 01:19:00.654
You. Get up.

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.992
Stop.

01:19:07.261 --> 01:19:08.598
Sit down.

01:19:14.368 --> 01:19:15.659
All right, I need you
to calm down right now.

01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:18.140
Hey! Look at me.

01:19:19.508 --> 01:19:20.510
Take a deep breath.

01:19:23.678 --> 01:19:25.204
Good.

01:19:25.214 --> 01:19:27.839
I know you already triggered
the silent alarms.

01:19:27.849 --> 01:19:29.707
So I need you
to pick up the phone,

01:19:29.717 --> 01:19:33.677
dial 911 dispatch,
and explain the following.

01:19:33.687 --> 01:19:35.357
Go ahead and write this down.

01:19:37.125 --> 01:19:41.620
There's a 211 in progress,
and we have hostages.

01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:44.388
Within one hour, they need
to deliver $10 million

01:19:44.398 --> 01:19:47.691
in unmarked small denomination
bills to this bank

01:19:47.701 --> 01:19:50.727
inside a department helicopter
loaded with fuel.

01:19:50.737 --> 01:19:55.299
Tell them we plan on killing one hostage
every hour until our demands are met.

01:19:55.309 --> 01:19:57.501
No cops are to
approach the bank.

01:19:57.511 --> 01:20:00.704
And if a negotiator
even tries to contact us,

01:20:00.714 --> 01:20:02.884
we will automatically kill
another hostage.

01:20:04.252 --> 01:20:06.721
Is that clear?
You got it all?

01:20:09.824 --> 01:20:11.327
Go ahead
and pick up the phone.

01:20:16.932 --> 01:20:19.324
<i>Any available units,
we have a bank 211 in progress...</i>

01:20:19.334 --> 01:20:20.658
Shit.

01:20:20.668 --> 01:20:21.825
<i>...at the Pico Rivera Savings
in Montebello</i>

01:20:21.835 --> 01:20:25.230
<i>at 2891 Wilcox and Atlantic.</i>

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.830
- <i>Suspects are armed...</i>
- What the fuck?

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:28.901
<i>...and have taken hostages
and are refusing a negotiator.</i>

01:20:28.911 --> 01:20:31.370
What the fuck is going on?
That's not their MO.

01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:34.771
Call in, tell them we're on scene,
have suspects under surveillance,

01:20:34.781 --> 01:20:36.340
and to back the fuck off.

01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:39.611
This is LASD, we have surveillance
on the bank. Stand down.

01:20:39.621 --> 01:20:43.048
I repeat,
have all units stand down.

01:20:43.058 --> 01:20:44.958
It's bullshit. I can
hear them already.

01:20:46.228 --> 01:20:47.748
What the fuck are they doing?

01:20:53.201 --> 01:20:54.392
Stop!

01:20:54.402 --> 01:20:55.703
Get out!

01:21:07.581 --> 01:21:09.618
What the fuck
are you guys doing, huh?

01:21:11.219 --> 01:21:12.544
Asshole!

01:21:12.554 --> 01:21:14.413
What the fuck are you doing?
What's going on?

01:21:14.423 --> 01:21:16.380
You were running surveillance,
and you let this shit go down?

01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:19.450
It's our fucking case. We've been
surveilling these guys for weeks.

01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:20.784
That's what surveillance is!

01:21:20.794 --> 01:21:23.455
They commit a crime,
and then we stop them.

01:21:23.465 --> 01:21:24.799
Go. Go to the vault.

01:21:25.665 --> 01:21:26.767
Open it.

01:21:41.648 --> 01:21:43.118
Let's go. Come.

01:21:46.455 --> 01:21:47.789
Sit. Sit down.

01:21:55.263 --> 01:21:57.821
I'm going to put this
on speaker phone.

01:21:57.831 --> 01:21:59.324
You're going to answer,
but don't use any names.

01:21:59.334 --> 01:22:00.635
You understand?

01:22:04.372 --> 01:22:05.629
Hello?

01:22:05.639 --> 01:22:07.999
<i>Hello, this is the Los Angeles
Police Department.</i>

01:22:08.009 --> 01:22:09.766
<i>Who am I speaking with?</i>

01:22:09.776 --> 01:22:11.169
This is the branch manager.

01:22:11.179 --> 01:22:13.170
<i>Sir, I need to speak
with the person in charge.</i>

01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:15.106
You are.

01:22:15.116 --> 01:22:18.309
<i>Okay, good. Well, let me introduce myself.
I'm Officer Parada...</i>

01:22:18.319 --> 01:22:23.348
I don't give a fuck who you are.
Are our demands being met?

01:22:23.358 --> 01:22:24.482
<i>Who am I talking with now?</i>

01:22:24.492 --> 01:22:26.017
Answer the question.

01:22:26.027 --> 01:22:27.717
It's being worked on
as we speak.

01:22:27.727 --> 01:22:28.954
<i>But you need to understand...</i>

01:22:28.964 --> 01:22:30.198
You just killed a hostage.

01:22:31.532 --> 01:22:33.035
God damn it!

01:22:39.706 --> 01:22:42.500
- Get up. Get up!
- No! No! No!

01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:44.201
Come on, move!

01:22:44.211 --> 01:22:46.571
I didn't do anything. Please.
What are you doing?

01:22:46.581 --> 01:22:51.053
- Come on.
- No! No! No!

01:22:55.389 --> 01:22:56.514
Fuck!

01:22:56.524 --> 01:22:58.383
- You were on it, huh?
- Shit!

01:22:58.393 --> 01:22:59.816
You're so full of shit,
O'Brien...

01:22:59.826 --> 01:23:01.718
You heard the demands,
you stupid motherfucker!

01:23:01.728 --> 01:23:04.889
- Yeah.
- You put a negotiator on? Christ!

01:23:04.899 --> 01:23:06.391
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

01:23:06.401 --> 01:23:07.558
Yeah, fuck you!

01:23:07.568 --> 01:23:09.527
Fucking nice haircut,
you fucking idiot.

01:23:09.537 --> 01:23:10.995
Who are you
fucking pushing now?

01:23:11.005 --> 01:23:12.364
Are you fucking kidding?

01:23:12.374 --> 01:23:14.499
- Get SWAT rolling right now!
- You fucking pussy.

01:23:14.509 --> 01:23:16.233
Fucking Lobbin' Bob is angry!

01:23:16.243 --> 01:23:18.570
- All right, boss, let's go. Let's go.
- Shitheads!

01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:20.671
- Let's go.
- Fuck!

01:23:20.681 --> 01:23:22.240
We've got a situation
going on...

01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:23.285
Shit!

01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.256
What the fuck are you
doing, Merrimen?

01:23:38.433 --> 01:23:39.891
Yeah?

01:23:39.901 --> 01:23:42.393
This is the Police Department.
Please don't hang up.

01:23:42.403 --> 01:23:44.096
My name's Danny,

01:23:44.106 --> 01:23:46.431
I'll be your only contact. Nobody
else is going to call you.

01:23:46.441 --> 01:23:48.432
<i>Is this the person in charge?</i>

01:23:48.442 --> 01:23:50.201
This is the branch manager.

01:23:50.211 --> 01:23:53.771
I'm speaking on the
man in charge's behalf.

01:23:53.781 --> 01:23:55.780
<i>Do you have a name,
branch manager?</i>

01:23:57.451 --> 01:24:00.922
Listen. They've already killed
one of the hostages. A woman.

01:24:02.124 --> 01:24:04.115
They will not
speak to you again.

01:24:04.125 --> 01:24:07.619
If you call back again before their
demands are met, they'll kill another.

01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:09.620
Just send what they want.

01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:11.589
<i>The money and the chopper
are en route,</i>

01:24:11.599 --> 01:24:13.258
<i>but it's going to take
a little bit of time.</i>

01:24:13.268 --> 01:24:16.505
<i>You need to give me at least
90 minutes. Is this doable?</i>

01:24:18.772 --> 01:24:20.775
Okay. Don't call back.

01:24:46.033 --> 01:24:47.291
What's the prefix here?

01:24:47.301 --> 01:24:48.636
562. It's Long Beach.

01:24:55.643 --> 01:24:57.334
Hello?

01:24:57.344 --> 01:24:58.546
You watching?

01:25:03.184 --> 01:25:04.185
Yup.

01:25:09.357 --> 01:25:11.438
So how the hell are you going
to get out of this one?

01:25:12.993 --> 01:25:14.496
Not sure yet.

01:25:18.633 --> 01:25:20.835
Did you get my number
from her cell?

01:25:27.642 --> 01:25:29.245
I ain't cuffing up.

01:25:31.844 --> 01:25:33.482
That's okay.

01:25:34.883 --> 01:25:37.419
I didn't bring
my cuffs anyway.

01:25:39.153 --> 01:25:40.889
Yeah, I can see that.

01:26:01.242 --> 01:26:02.776
Was that who I think it was?

01:26:03.444 --> 01:26:04.612
Yup.

01:26:11.751 --> 01:26:13.277
We've got a chopper
that's gonna come down.

01:26:13.287 --> 01:26:15.048
The chopper is going to land
right over here.

01:26:23.063 --> 01:26:27.302
I've got two-door entry on one.
One-door entry on two.

01:26:28.937 --> 01:26:29.939
Breaching!

01:26:36.978 --> 01:26:38.614
Well, they just
blew the vault.

01:26:39.281 --> 01:26:40.648
What the fuck?

01:26:51.091 --> 01:26:52.450
<i>Federal Reserve,
accounts receiving.</i>

01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:54.285
Hey, it's Al at Alameda.

01:26:54.295 --> 01:26:56.955
We have a drop at Pico Rivera
we need to schedule.

01:26:56.965 --> 01:26:58.923
<i>How's Wednesday at 2:00?</i>

01:26:58.933 --> 01:27:01.293
<i>That works. You're confirmed
for 2:00 p.m. the 18th.</i>

01:27:01.303 --> 01:27:03.495
<i>Great. Thanks.</i>

01:27:03.505 --> 01:27:05.074
- We're here, yeah?
- Yeah, that's us.

01:27:06.308 --> 01:27:07.675
So what is this?

01:27:08.643 --> 01:27:10.168
This is the sewer line,

01:27:10.178 --> 01:27:12.948
and according to this map right
here, it's all cemented up.

01:27:33.167 --> 01:27:34.527
Hey, where are we
with the chopper?

01:27:35.336 --> 01:27:37.495
We're waiting on clearance.

01:27:37.505 --> 01:27:39.496
Relax, they're not
going anywhere.

01:27:39.506 --> 01:27:42.833
To hell with clearance.
We've got to move.

01:27:42.843 --> 01:27:44.280
O'Brien, hey!

01:27:45.678 --> 01:27:48.339
Is he off his meds?

01:27:48.349 --> 01:27:50.342
Tell him to get
the fuck back here!

01:27:50.352 --> 01:27:51.843
Will you shut the fuck up?

01:27:51.853 --> 01:27:53.022
Oh, fuck you.

01:28:03.197 --> 01:28:05.722
We better go back him up.

01:28:05.732 --> 01:28:07.291
Nick's heading to the front.
We're on the move.

01:28:07.301 --> 01:28:08.304
Here we go.

01:28:13.974 --> 01:28:15.977
- Fuck!
- Is he serious?

01:28:39.233 --> 01:28:40.557
Everybody okay?

01:28:40.567 --> 01:28:41.903
Yes.

01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:52.278
Please, Lord, please,
let me see my family again.

01:29:07.429 --> 01:29:08.629
- Nick!
- Sheriff's Department.

01:29:09.930 --> 01:29:11.089
Nick!

01:29:11.099 --> 01:29:12.134
Clear!

01:29:15.402 --> 01:29:16.770
Clear!

01:29:24.411 --> 01:29:26.615
- The fuck?
- Nick, what's your location?

01:29:30.484 --> 01:29:31.785
<i>What's your location?</i>

01:29:40.295 --> 01:29:42.454
Hey, this is Al
at Alameda again.

01:29:42.464 --> 01:29:44.989
I forgot to schedule a drop
at the Pico Rivera Savings.

01:29:44.999 --> 01:29:46.635
What do you have open today?

01:29:54.175 --> 01:29:56.667
<i>Ghetto Bird, this is Silverback.
We confirmed?</i>

01:29:56.677 --> 01:30:00.148
Check. Appointment's at 2:45.
That's in two minutes.

01:30:14.027 --> 01:30:15.296
Pico Rivera.

01:30:23.972 --> 01:30:25.829
Horsepower all set?

01:30:25.839 --> 01:30:27.342
<i>Yeah, I'm ready to go.</i>

01:30:41.655 --> 01:30:43.181
They got you
on a new route?

01:30:43.191 --> 01:30:46.049
Yeah. Yeah, they just
switched us over this week.

01:30:46.059 --> 01:30:49.785
All right. Let me
get you guys' IDs, man.

01:30:49.795 --> 01:30:52.533
Yeah, sure. There you go.

01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:01.542
All right.

01:31:02.376 --> 01:31:03.867
You're good to go.

01:31:03.877 --> 01:31:06.117
- All right, thank you.
- Open the gate. Have a good one.

01:31:47.554 --> 01:31:48.557
Oh, fuck.

01:31:58.732 --> 01:32:01.092
Pico Rivera Savings? 2.2?

01:32:01.102 --> 01:32:02.593
Yup, that's us.

01:32:02.603 --> 01:32:03.962
Bring her up.

01:32:03.972 --> 01:32:05.941
All right, ready.
One, two, three.

01:32:13.246 --> 01:32:15.249
- Sign here.
- You got it.

01:32:16.584 --> 01:32:17.920
You're new here, Mark?

01:32:18.952 --> 01:32:20.155
Yes, sir.

01:32:22.389 --> 01:32:23.814
You guys running
a little bit late.

01:32:23.824 --> 01:32:26.929
Yeah, we ran into
some traffic, so...

01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:30.254
I don't know where they had
you guys routed before,

01:32:30.264 --> 01:32:32.557
but we run a tight, tight ship
around here,

01:32:32.567 --> 01:32:34.959
so, if you're going to be
late, have base call it in.

01:32:34.969 --> 01:32:36.427
Yeah, no problem.
That's my fault. I just...

01:32:36.437 --> 01:32:38.806
Just have them call.

01:32:39.806 --> 01:32:40.943
On me.

01:33:19.812 --> 01:33:22.507
Hey, Luigi. Alameda's on deck.
Check them in.

01:33:22.517 --> 01:33:23.683
Copy that.

01:33:24.184 --> 01:33:25.486
New guys.

01:33:26.652 --> 01:33:28.322
I'm going to
step out for a minute.

01:33:55.715 --> 01:33:57.040
How you guys doing today?

01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:58.853
- Good. All right.
- Good.

01:34:04.758 --> 01:34:05.916
How you doing?

01:34:05.926 --> 01:34:08.553
- All right, how are you?
- Good, thank you.

01:34:08.563 --> 01:34:10.098
Sign that for me, please.

01:34:12.732 --> 01:34:14.725
All hundreds?

01:34:14.735 --> 01:34:17.539
The first one's all hundreds.
The second one is mixed.

01:34:18.539 --> 01:34:19.996
We're a little backed up.

01:34:20.006 --> 01:34:21.566
All right, do what you can.

01:34:21.576 --> 01:34:23.833
Guys want to hang out, get a Coke
or something? Appreciate you.

01:34:23.843 --> 01:34:24.844
Thank you.

01:34:35.389 --> 01:34:37.713
We're going to need access
to the recording off-site.

01:34:37.723 --> 01:34:39.416
Can you get that to us?

01:34:39.426 --> 01:34:41.396
- Understood.
- You need professional help.

01:34:42.130 --> 01:34:43.254
Desperately.

01:34:43.264 --> 01:34:45.934
My bad last time.
Your crime scene.

01:35:13.094 --> 01:35:16.120
Silverback, this
is Horsepower. I'm in.

01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:19.666
Greenpeace, this is Silverback.
Horsepower is in.

01:35:21.434 --> 01:35:23.803
Roger that, Silverback.
Lights out.

01:35:31.978 --> 01:35:33.514
Okay, here we go.

01:35:36.616 --> 01:35:38.976
Johnny, we're fucking brown
again, man.

01:35:38.986 --> 01:35:41.089
Got to shut down. Pull them
out of the count rooms.

01:35:42.189 --> 01:35:44.647
We're going brown.

01:35:44.657 --> 01:35:47.218
We've got to shut down for a bit.
All teams go ahead and take 10.

01:35:57.271 --> 01:35:58.329
Luigi, come on.

01:35:58.339 --> 01:36:00.708
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:36:13.487 --> 01:36:15.357
They went to brown.
They're clearing out.

01:36:17.558 --> 01:36:19.359
- Let's lock it down.
- Copy.

01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:26.167
Get ready to go.

01:36:38.745 --> 01:36:40.346
<i>Powering up EMP now.</i>

01:36:46.652 --> 01:36:47.879
All clear here.

01:36:47.889 --> 01:36:48.890
Good to go.

01:36:52.026 --> 01:36:53.260
You're clear. Go.

01:37:01.335 --> 01:37:02.994
Shit. Check something out.

01:37:03.004 --> 01:37:04.562
What do you think it is?

01:37:04.572 --> 01:37:06.241
Are the cameras up
in the 100 room?

01:37:07.008 --> 01:37:08.741
Uh, negative.

01:37:14.282 --> 01:37:16.440
555-0143.

01:37:16.450 --> 01:37:17.586
It's taking too long.

01:37:18.618 --> 01:37:19.910
Tasty Orders.

01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:21.245
<i>This is Sharon at the Fed.</i>

01:37:21.255 --> 01:37:23.513
<i>Now, we ordered almost
an hour and a half ago.</i>

01:37:23.523 --> 01:37:25.383
<i>Now, I only have so much time
on my lunch break.</i>

01:37:25.393 --> 01:37:27.584
It coming!
Be there in a few minute!

01:37:27.594 --> 01:37:29.186
They just called
for the Chinese.

01:37:29.196 --> 01:37:30.298
<i>Hurry it up.</i>

01:37:33.732 --> 01:37:35.459
Motion is out in there, too.

01:37:35.469 --> 01:37:36.770
Yeah, man, we're still brown.

01:37:38.872 --> 01:37:41.432
You know, we better override.
Power it up.

01:37:41.442 --> 01:37:42.444
All right.

01:37:44.811 --> 01:37:45.902
Done.

01:37:45.912 --> 01:37:47.482
Okay. Better get
that count, too.

01:37:59.393 --> 01:38:01.953
Shit, here comes security.
Get down. Get down.

01:38:01.963 --> 01:38:04.633
Hey, man, we got to check this 100 count.
Motion went off.

01:38:12.505 --> 01:38:13.797
Luigi...

01:38:13.807 --> 01:38:15.310
Step on it.
Step on it, quick.

01:38:17.611 --> 01:38:18.735
Yeah?

01:38:18.745 --> 01:38:20.170
- Luigi.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:23.441
Damn, dude! Luigi, you're
stepping on the line, man!

01:38:23.451 --> 01:38:25.108
Say again? Russell?

01:38:25.118 --> 01:38:27.788
Hey, dumb-dumb. You've got to
let go of the push to talk.

01:38:30.656 --> 01:38:32.459
What the hell is
going on here today?

01:38:35.963 --> 01:38:37.321
<i>Luigi, man. He's stepping
all over the line.</i>

01:38:37.331 --> 01:38:38.821
<i>He's</i> hot-micing
<i>like a motherfucker.</i>

01:38:38.831 --> 01:38:41.358
He's in the cafeteria.
Go ahead and get him.

01:38:41.368 --> 01:38:43.338
<i>All right. Roger that.
I'm stepping out.</i>

01:38:52.045 --> 01:38:53.280
You're clear. Go.

01:39:01.522 --> 01:39:02.524
Holy shit.

01:39:40.094 --> 01:39:41.886
Luigi, you're hot-micing.

01:39:41.896 --> 01:39:43.820
You've got to let go of the talk button.
You're stepping on the line.

01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:45.821
Dude, it's not me.

01:39:45.831 --> 01:39:48.392
Come on, we've got to check the 100 count.
Let's go. Get Junior. Let's go.

01:39:48.402 --> 01:39:50.061
<i>Switch to line five.</i>

01:39:50.071 --> 01:39:52.312
You got about a minute and a
half, two minutes. Let's go.

01:40:20.767 --> 01:40:21.870
They're back. Get out.

01:41:01.341 --> 01:41:03.400
Luigi, you see anything, man?

01:41:03.410 --> 01:41:05.335
Yeah, we're good. There's
nothing back there but dust.

01:41:05.345 --> 01:41:07.271
What am I looking for?

01:41:07.281 --> 01:41:08.906
Don't worry about it, man. I'm gonna
juice up the room. Run the count,

01:41:08.916 --> 01:41:10.916
- <i>and make sure we're good, all right?</i>
- Copy that.

01:41:11.784 --> 01:41:13.977
Where are you?

01:41:13.987 --> 01:41:15.856
This is Horsepower.
I'm in the vents.

01:41:22.929 --> 01:41:24.631
Greenpeace, you're done.
Cut out.

01:41:28.102 --> 01:41:30.692
We are back up, brother.

01:41:30.702 --> 01:41:32.874
All teams,
back to the count room.

01:41:35.341 --> 01:41:36.967
Get on with LAPD Central.

01:41:36.977 --> 01:41:40.103
Tell them we're running
surveillance at 8th and Grand.

01:41:40.113 --> 01:41:43.173
<i>Request a Code 5. We do not
wanna spook the suspects.</i>

01:41:43.183 --> 01:41:45.184
<i>Copy that.
Putting in a Code 5.</i>

01:41:47.353 --> 01:41:50.147
Am I tripping or
was this full before?

01:41:50.157 --> 01:41:51.526
Let's just check the count.

01:42:21.487 --> 01:42:22.557
$712,200.

01:42:24.591 --> 01:42:26.027
$712,200.

01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:29.330
Russell, the count is on.

01:42:30.898 --> 01:42:33.156
All right, roger that. Go
ahead and clock out Alameda.

01:42:33.166 --> 01:42:34.568
Take Alameda out.

01:42:56.755 --> 01:42:58.548
The count was good.

01:42:58.558 --> 01:43:00.717
But both of your bins
were half-full.

01:43:00.727 --> 01:43:02.386
Sorry?

01:43:02.396 --> 01:43:04.264
Your bins,
they were half-full.

01:43:05.633 --> 01:43:07.057
That's how we got them.

01:43:07.067 --> 01:43:10.861
Next time, just put it
in a cash sack.

01:43:10.871 --> 01:43:12.562
Makes things a lot easier.

01:43:12.572 --> 01:43:14.865
Try and work smart, not hard.

01:43:14.875 --> 01:43:16.475
Okay, sounds good.
Thanks for the advice.

01:45:04.417 --> 01:45:08.212
We would tip you, honey, but that
just took too damn long, okay?

01:45:08.222 --> 01:45:10.462
I'm the only guy they've got
delivering today. I'm sorry.

01:45:36.749 --> 01:45:39.120
Sorry, guys, let me see
your drop confirmation again.

01:45:41.021 --> 01:45:42.290
- All right.
- There you go.

01:45:58.704 --> 01:46:00.274
Chinese food guy?

01:46:00.974 --> 01:46:02.543
Go on. Buzz him in.

01:46:07.947 --> 01:46:09.082
Hold him there.

01:46:12.286 --> 01:46:13.421
2-4-5.

01:46:20.259 --> 01:46:21.595
Yeah, send him through.

01:46:24.398 --> 01:46:26.901
Come here for a sec, buddy.

01:46:29.635 --> 01:46:31.472
Yeah, man, I don't
have you signed in.

01:46:35.408 --> 01:46:37.233
Where's your name?

01:46:37.243 --> 01:46:40.303
Come on, man, I signed my name with
a dude from the last shift, man.

01:46:40.313 --> 01:46:41.581
I don't know what to tell you.

01:46:45.352 --> 01:46:46.442
Mmm-mmm.

01:46:46.452 --> 01:46:48.156
Damn you finicky.

01:46:49.289 --> 01:46:50.745
- I'm getting my money back.
- Okay.

01:46:50.755 --> 01:46:52.815
- I'm getting my money back.
- Okay.

01:46:52.825 --> 01:46:53.827
That's all I need.

01:46:59.198 --> 01:47:01.157
All right, you boys
are good to go.

01:47:01.167 --> 01:47:02.691
- Thank you very much, Officer.
- Take it easy.

01:47:02.701 --> 01:47:04.205
- You have a good day.
- All right.

01:47:10.877 --> 01:47:13.180
- Go on. Get out of here.
- Thank you.

01:47:16.816 --> 01:47:18.618
Yes, security in
the lobby, please.

01:47:27.894 --> 01:47:29.018
Lobby.

01:47:29.028 --> 01:47:31.021
Yeah, did you see
a delivery guy?

01:47:31.031 --> 01:47:33.401
Red shirt, light skin.
About 6 foot.

01:47:34.834 --> 01:47:36.904
- Wait, what?
- Stop him.

01:47:41.308 --> 01:47:44.212
You got eyes on the 1-2 side?
We'll cover the 3-4 corner.

01:47:45.211 --> 01:47:46.679
Copy that.

01:47:59.026 --> 01:48:01.218
Got held up at security.
What's your location?

01:48:01.228 --> 01:48:04.087
South on Grand,
just past Vernon.

01:48:04.097 --> 01:48:06.722
<i>Go right on Gage.
Right on Gage.</i>

01:48:06.732 --> 01:48:07.767
Copy that.

01:48:29.022 --> 01:48:30.914
Move! Let's go! Get out!

01:48:30.924 --> 01:48:33.383
- Come on, move! Move! Here we go!
- It's cool.

01:48:33.393 --> 01:48:35.605
- Come on, get down! Go! Go! Go!
- It's cool. I'm cool, man.

01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:36.964
Be cool, bro. Cool.

01:48:38.697 --> 01:48:40.100
Fuck.

01:48:59.486 --> 01:49:01.244
There he is. There he is.
Red shirt. Two blocks ahead.

01:49:01.254 --> 01:49:03.045
Eyes on suspect.

01:49:03.055 --> 01:49:07.150
Walking eastbound on 9th, approaching
Hill, south side of street.

01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:09.585
Pull up in front of him,
in front of him.

01:49:09.595 --> 01:49:11.221
Let's get this motherfucker.

01:49:11.231 --> 01:49:12.951
Let's ram his bitch-ass
into the gate first.

01:49:15.635 --> 01:49:18.104
Get in the fucking car!
Come on. Get in.

01:49:19.906 --> 01:49:21.175
Fuck.

01:49:21.642 --> 01:49:22.741
Hit him!

01:49:31.683 --> 01:49:33.753
Motherfucker.

01:49:50.437 --> 01:49:53.117
All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's
get it done as quick as we can.

01:49:57.978 --> 01:49:59.936
Little fuck.

01:49:59.946 --> 01:50:02.383
Where is he?
Where the fuck is he, asshole?

01:50:03.349 --> 01:50:04.352
Fuck.

01:50:07.019 --> 01:50:08.888
<i>Fucking... Fucker!</i>

01:50:10.822 --> 01:50:13.692
Give me the burner phone.
Where the fuck is he?

01:50:17.964 --> 01:50:20.123
Pacific Horizon Salvage.

01:50:20.133 --> 01:50:22.669
In South Gate.
That's the rally point.

01:50:31.978 --> 01:50:33.837
Silverback, go.

01:50:33.847 --> 01:50:35.383
<i>Horsepower's burned.</i>

01:50:37.349 --> 01:50:38.842
Repeat that. I can't hear you.

01:50:38.852 --> 01:50:41.044
Horsepower is burned.

01:50:41.054 --> 01:50:42.689
<i>He's done.</i>

01:50:44.057 --> 01:50:45.859
I'm still clean.
Where am I going, bro?

01:51:05.444 --> 01:51:07.337
Fuck!

01:51:07.347 --> 01:51:09.272
Let's go. Let's go.
You guys got it all?

01:51:09.282 --> 01:51:10.906
- Yes, it's all in.
- Pick it up.

01:51:10.916 --> 01:51:11.919
It's good.

01:51:14.019 --> 01:51:17.947
Pacific Horizon Salvage.
South Gate, Alameda Corridor.

01:51:17.957 --> 01:51:19.527
10-4. Headed to you.

01:51:26.366 --> 01:51:27.846
What happened
to the other two?

01:51:31.803 --> 01:51:33.441
They got burned.

01:51:59.099 --> 01:52:00.456
Eyes on suspects.

01:52:00.466 --> 01:52:02.169
Black, four-door Suburban!

01:52:07.941 --> 01:52:09.808
Heading southbound on Alameda.

01:52:12.344 --> 01:52:16.583
Approaching Slauson Avenue. I need
you to parallel me on Santa Fe.

01:52:26.192 --> 01:52:28.027
We got some traffic up ahead.
What's going on?

01:52:29.295 --> 01:52:30.597
Corridor's backed up.

01:52:37.504 --> 01:52:40.305
We just turned down Alameda Corridor,
heading south.

01:52:49.616 --> 01:52:50.717
Shit.

01:52:59.791 --> 01:53:01.784
Coming up on suspect,
six o'clock.

01:53:01.794 --> 01:53:03.186
Shit.

01:53:03.196 --> 01:53:05.355
Right lane is closed up ahead.

01:53:05.365 --> 01:53:08.501
<i>I repeat, right lane is
closed up ahead.</i>

01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:15.632
You guys see that?

01:53:15.642 --> 01:53:17.710
Twenty, 30 cars back.
What is that?

01:53:21.714 --> 01:53:22.983
Is that...

01:53:27.853 --> 01:53:29.889
Okay, we're at
a stop, stop, stop.

01:53:32.058 --> 01:53:33.726
Fuck backup.
We've got to move now.

01:53:34.594 --> 01:53:35.896
Fuck.

01:53:43.269 --> 01:53:44.370
Yup.

01:53:50.410 --> 01:53:51.742
That's them.

01:53:57.450 --> 01:53:59.674
- Give me my vest.
- Yeah.

01:53:59.684 --> 01:54:01.255
Yeah, here we go.

01:54:04.925 --> 01:54:07.416
Okay, we've got them pinched in. We've
got to move before it opens up.

01:54:07.426 --> 01:54:08.760
Cuff him up.

01:54:18.704 --> 01:54:21.263
Be advised, suspects wearing
body armor.

01:54:21.273 --> 01:54:24.066
No center mass shots.
Limb and head shots only.

01:54:24.076 --> 01:54:25.316
Copy that.
Go around right here.

01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:31.552
It's jammed up.

01:54:38.656 --> 01:54:40.659
Good? Okay, let's go.

01:54:51.571 --> 01:54:53.463
- Oh, shit.
- What?

01:54:53.473 --> 01:54:54.673
They're getting
out of the car.

01:55:00.513 --> 01:55:02.138
Z, go down the right.

01:55:02.148 --> 01:55:05.141
Gus, Borracho, center with me.

01:55:05.151 --> 01:55:07.754
Murph, stay on the left.
Don't come in.

01:55:08.654 --> 01:55:10.256
- Pass me the saw.
- Fuck.

01:55:12.657 --> 01:55:14.260
Let's go.

01:55:15.161 --> 01:55:16.330
Stay down. Stay down.

01:55:43.722 --> 01:55:45.059
Get down. Get down.

01:55:49.328 --> 01:55:51.528
- Sheriff's Department. Stay down.
- Get down. Get down.

01:55:58.905 --> 01:56:01.140
- Get down.
- Sheriff's Department, stay down.

01:56:04.309 --> 01:56:06.479
Get down. Get down.
Stay by the engine block.

01:56:09.815 --> 01:56:11.352
Get down behind the wheel.

01:56:18.892 --> 01:56:20.572
Sheriff's Department.
Lady, get in the car.

01:56:26.433 --> 01:56:27.533
Oh, shit.

01:56:30.236 --> 01:56:31.505
Borracho!

01:56:37.911 --> 01:56:38.946
Moving!

01:56:41.581 --> 01:56:42.583
Moving.

01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:05.428
Gus, Murph, you two go across
and cut them off, okay?

01:57:05.438 --> 01:57:07.875
Tony Z, you ready?

01:57:08.608 --> 01:57:09.943
Let's go.

01:57:32.731 --> 01:57:33.766
Moving!

01:57:38.638 --> 01:57:39.640
Move!

01:57:44.843 --> 01:57:47.081
Moving. Moving.

01:57:52.152 --> 01:57:53.520
Mag change!

01:58:00.125 --> 01:58:01.127
Moving.

01:58:06.131 --> 01:58:07.201
Mag change.

01:58:19.545 --> 01:58:20.546
Moving!

01:58:25.784 --> 01:58:27.019
Go! Go! Peel off!

01:58:37.362 --> 01:58:38.487
Tony, you okay?

01:58:38.497 --> 01:58:40.200
- Yeah, go! Go!
- You okay?

01:58:41.166 --> 01:58:42.169
Fuck!

01:58:47.206 --> 01:58:48.207
Go!

01:58:56.182 --> 01:58:57.184
Cover!

01:59:02.255 --> 01:59:03.257
Move.

01:59:13.366 --> 01:59:14.535
Fuck!

01:59:31.350 --> 01:59:32.774
Brick wall! Brick wall!

01:59:32.784 --> 01:59:34.254
Behind the brick building!

02:01:22.027 --> 02:01:23.461
My kids...

02:01:24.964 --> 02:01:26.466
You're in His hands now.

02:01:27.567 --> 02:01:28.868
You hear me?

02:02:18.451 --> 02:02:19.453
Fuck!

02:04:01.686 --> 02:04:02.889
Don't do it.

02:04:29.916 --> 02:04:31.548
Told you.

02:04:46.731 --> 02:04:48.666
Yeah. You did.

02:05:51.930 --> 02:05:53.332
What the fuck?

02:06:04.643 --> 02:06:05.843
You see this?

02:06:06.978 --> 02:06:08.314
Here. Do those.

02:06:13.486 --> 02:06:14.487
Oh, shit.

02:06:21.160 --> 02:06:24.497
So what? They were going to
make fucking snow globes?

02:06:25.664 --> 02:06:27.500
Like 10,000 of them?

02:06:36.708 --> 02:06:38.601
You check on the boys?

02:06:38.611 --> 02:06:40.679
Yeah, I'm going
to roll to the hospital.

02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:47.621
You gonna call
Borracho's wife?

02:06:56.295 --> 02:06:57.397
Yeah.

02:07:00.566 --> 02:07:02.035
All right.

02:07:04.170 --> 02:07:05.704
This won't go to Harbor.

02:07:24.656 --> 02:07:26.426
I'm sorry you lost
one of your guys.

02:07:28.393 --> 02:07:29.584
Thanks.

02:07:29.594 --> 02:07:31.053
You all right?

02:07:31.063 --> 02:07:32.499
Yeah, I'm okay.

02:07:33.898 --> 02:07:35.257
Yeah.

02:07:35.267 --> 02:07:38.438
Nick, you've got to stop
smoking, man.

02:07:39.237 --> 02:07:40.240
Here.

02:07:42.073 --> 02:07:43.442
It's organic.

02:07:51.916 --> 02:07:54.553
You know everything was accounted
for at the Fed, right?

02:07:56.956 --> 02:07:58.291
Apparently so.

02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:30.349
Hey, is Donnie around?

02:09:32.283 --> 02:09:33.353
He quit.

02:09:35.854 --> 02:09:37.456
So you haven't
seen him anywhere?

02:09:38.790 --> 02:09:40.360
I said he quit.

02:09:41.192 --> 02:09:42.394
Two days ago.

02:09:58.042 --> 02:09:59.379
You want a beer?

02:10:00.144 --> 02:10:03.046
Very much so. Like 50.

02:10:09.388 --> 02:10:11.090
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:10:25.837 --> 02:10:28.496
Did you see that new chick?
Little fat-ass?

02:10:28.506 --> 02:10:31.277
The new girl who
works down the hall?

02:10:32.411 --> 02:10:34.837
What's going on, gentlemen?

02:10:34.847 --> 02:10:36.839
- Gentlemen, good to see you.
- Yo!

02:10:36.849 --> 02:10:41.020
- Good to see you.
- Your wife know where you are?

02:10:56.434 --> 02:10:57.792
How did you get that job?

02:10:57.802 --> 02:10:59.104
Can you actually count?

02:11:00.772 --> 02:11:02.932
<i>I'm in complete
control of my environment.</i>

02:11:02.942 --> 02:11:04.042
People don't even know.

02:11:33.005 --> 02:11:34.740
Fucking <i>Fräulein.</i>

02:11:44.316 --> 02:11:46.342
What's going on, boys?

02:11:46.352 --> 02:11:47.686
How you doing? You good?

02:11:48.652 --> 02:11:49.820
Some beers?

02:11:50.322 --> 02:11:51.847
Hey, guv.

02:11:51.857 --> 02:11:53.459
A round of beers for my mates.

02:11:54.425 --> 02:11:56.151
And for you?

02:11:56.161 --> 02:11:57.163
I'm easy.

02:12:02.166 --> 02:12:03.335
I don't know.

02:12:03.868 --> 02:12:04.871
Surprise me.

02:12:08.006 --> 02:12:09.442
I can do that.

02:12:10.674 --> 02:12:12.344
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

02:12:13.344 --> 02:12:14.870
So why you come to me?

02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:16.538
You're a beast, man.

02:12:16.548 --> 02:12:18.106
Plus, you're the only one
that can pull this off.

02:12:18.116 --> 02:12:20.041
Listen.

02:12:20.051 --> 02:12:22.011
We do this, I call the shots.

02:12:22.021 --> 02:12:23.722
My crew, my job, not yours.

02:12:24.722 --> 02:12:26.514
Got it?

02:12:26.524 --> 02:12:28.684
- Completely understand.
- That's the way it has to be.

02:12:29.862 --> 02:12:31.186
That's it.

02:12:31.196 --> 02:12:32.787
It's my baby.

02:12:32.797 --> 02:12:34.032
That's what I've got.

02:12:35.700 --> 02:12:37.526
How did you get
a hold of all this stuff?

02:12:37.536 --> 02:12:39.895
You got this all at that bar?

02:12:39.905 --> 02:12:41.407
Collected it over time.

02:12:43.875 --> 02:12:44.910
Wow.

02:12:54.818 --> 02:12:55.921
Job for Superman.

02:13:09.268 --> 02:13:11.360
Cheers.

02:13:11.370 --> 02:13:13.570
Thank you. I love when
you call me Princess.

02:13:14.907 --> 02:13:16.275
You work across the street?

02:13:16.942 --> 02:13:17.944
Yeah.

02:13:18.609 --> 02:13:20.235
Diamond exchange?

02:13:20.245 --> 02:13:21.247
That's right.

02:13:25.084 --> 02:13:26.352
Beer's on me.
