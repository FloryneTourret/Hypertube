00:34:34.155 --> 00:34:36.943

Oh, wait a second, it's me!

- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

00:34:49.879 --> 00:34:51.120
The Thanos-killing kind.

00:34:51.965 --> 00:34:53.456
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

00:34:53.633 --> 00:34:55.670
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

00:34:55.844 --> 00:34:56.925

00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:04.683

another stone...

00:35:04.853 --> 00:35:06.389
he'll be too powerful to stop.

00:35:06.563 --> 00:35:08.725

Thanos isn't.

00:46:38.337 --> 00:46:41.000
of standing
so incredibly still...

00:46:42.216 --> 00:46:44.799
that I become
invisible to the eye.

00:46:45.428 --> 00:46:46.418
Watch.

00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:51.931
You're eating a zarg-nut.

00:46:52.393 --> 00:46:53.804
But my movement...

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:56.261
was so slow...

00:46:57.106 --> 00:46:58.938
that it's imperceptible.

00:46:59.108 --> 00:47:00.098
Mmm, no.

00:47:00.192 --> 00:47:02.525
(CRUNCHING)
I'm sure I'm invisible.

00:47:02.695 --> 00:47:03.856
MANTIS: Hi, Drax.

00:47:06.574 --> 00:47:07.564
Damn it.

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.211
This place looks deserted.

00:47:29.388 --> 00:47:32.131
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.

00:47:32.308 --> 00:47:34.220
PETER: Yep,
I'm picking that up too.

00:47:35.644 --> 00:47:37.101
Let's put down right here.

00:47:48.866 --> 00:47:50.402
THE COLLECTOR:
I don't have it.

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:54.243
THANOS: Everyone
in the galaxy knows

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:55.741
you'd sell your own brother...

00:47:55.915 --> 00:47:57.531
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...

00:47:57.708 --> 00:47:59.620
to your pathetic collection.

00:48:07.426 --> 00:48:09.839
I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.

00:48:10.805 --> 00:48:14.264
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

00:48:15.601 --> 00:48:16.637
(GROANS)

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.102
THE COLLECTOR: (STRAINED)
I told you.

00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:20.887
I sold it.

00:48:23.776 --> 00:48:25.768
Why would I lie?

00:48:25.945 --> 00:48:28.153
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.

00:48:28.989 --> 00:48:30.696
Like suicide.

00:48:30.866 --> 00:48:32.357
You do understand.

00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:36.320
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

00:48:36.497 --> 00:48:37.863
I didn't know what it was.

00:48:38.249 --> 00:48:40.832
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:42.200
It's him.

00:48:42.378 --> 00:48:43.835
THANOS: Last chance,
charlatan.

00:48:43.921 --> 00:48:45.287
(WHEEZING)

00:48:45.381 --> 00:48:47.338
Where's the stone?

00:48:47.508 --> 00:48:48.498
Today...

00:48:48.926 --> 00:48:49.916
(WHISPERING) Drax. Drax.

00:48:50.094 --> 00:48:52.051
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

00:48:52.138 --> 00:48:53.174
Drax, wait.

00:48:54.682 --> 00:48:56.048
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

00:48:56.225 --> 00:48:57.466
Drax.

00:49:01.355 --> 00:49:03.597
Drax, Drax, Drax.
Listen to me.

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:06.016
He doesn't have the stone yet.

00:49:06.193 --> 00:49:07.809
If we get it,
then we can stop him.

00:49:08.654 --> 00:49:11.818
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.

00:49:11.991 --> 00:49:13.072
No.

00:49:13.242 --> 00:49:16.280
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

00:49:16.745 --> 00:49:18.031

Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

That was quick.

00:50:43.374 --> 00:50:48.244
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!

00:50:50.589 --> 00:50:53.297

I sense in you, daughter?</i>

00:50:56.428 --> 00:50:58.920

I knew you still cared.</i>

00:51:06.313 --> 00:51:09.556
<i>But one never knows for sure.</i>

00:51:18.784 --> 00:51:21.618
<i>Reality is often
disappointing.</i>

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:27.032
That is, it was.

00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:30.452
Now...

00:51:32.464 --> 00:51:35.252
reality can be
whatever I want.

00:51:36.802 --> 00:51:38.259
You knew I'd come.

00:51:38.429 --> 00:51:40.045
THANOS: I counted on it.

00:51:40.848 --> 00:51:43.761
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

(GAMORA GRUNTS, SCREAMS)

(GROANS)

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.702

GAMORA: Peter.

00:52:07.625 --> 00:52:08.866
I told you to go right.

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:10.826
Now? Really?

00:52:11.003 --> 00:52:12.414
You let her go!

00:52:12.838 --> 00:52:14.545
- Ah, the boyfriend.
- (GROANS)

00:52:14.715 --> 00:52:15.705
No.

00:52:15.883 --> 00:52:17.044
Like to think of myself

00:52:17.134 --> 00:52:19.592
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.

00:52:19.762 --> 00:52:21.799
- Let her go.
- Peter.

00:52:21.972 --> 00:52:26.683
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.

00:52:27.269 --> 00:52:28.760
Not him.

You expect too much from him.

She's asked, hasn't she?

00:53:00.427 --> 00:53:01.417
Do it.

00:53:05.265 --> 00:53:06.506
Mmm.

I love you more than anything.

00:53:25.411 --> 00:53:26.902
I love you too.

(BREATHING RAPIDLY)

SECRETARY ROSS: (ON SPEAKER)
<i>Still no word from Vision?</i>

00:54:15.043 --> 00:54:17.660
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

00:54:18.297 --> 00:54:19.333
<i>Qn a stolen Quinjet</i>

00:54:19.423 --> 00:54:21.210
<i>with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.</i>

00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:23.257
You know they're
only criminals because

00:54:23.343 --> 00:54:24.834
you've chosen to
call them that, right, sir?

00:54:25.012 --> 00:54:26.128
<i>My God, Rhodes.</i>

<i>Your talent for horseshit

If it weren't
for those Accords,

00:54:30.893 --> 00:54:32.259
Vision would've been
right here.

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:36.229
<i>I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.</i>

00:54:36.732 --> 00:54:37.722
That's right.

00:54:39.735 --> 00:54:41.567
And I'm pretty sure
I paid for that.

00:54:41.737 --> 00:54:42.944
<i>You have second thoughts?</i>

00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:44.820
Not anymore.

Mr. Secretary.

<i>I'll give you that.</i>

I'm not looking
for forgiveness.

And I'm way past
asking permission.

00:55:16.271 --> 00:55:18.308
Earth just lost
her best defender.

00:55:18.816 --> 00:55:20.023
So we're here to fight.

00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:23.522

stand in our way...

(SIGHS) Wow. You guys...

00:55:51.765 --> 00:55:53.757
really look like crap.

00:55:53.934 --> 00:55:55.516
Must've been
a rough couple years.

00:55:55.686 --> 00:55:58.349
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

00:55:58.814 --> 00:56:00.976

you look great.

00:56:04.319 --> 00:56:05.400
Uh...

(CHUCKLES)

00:56:08.073 --> 00:56:10.110
Yeah, I'm back.

00:56:11.785 --> 00:56:12.775
Hi, Bruce.

00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:19.323
Nat.

00:56:22.754 --> 00:56:24.290
This is awkward.

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.336
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:29.671
And they can clearly find us.

00:56:29.845 --> 00:56:32.053
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

00:56:32.347 --> 00:56:33.804

Accords situation,

00:56:33.932 --> 00:56:35.423
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough

00:56:35.601 --> 00:56:37.137
on their families.
They're on house arrest.

- BANNER: Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

00:56:38.729 --> 00:56:40.186
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

00:56:41.106 --> 00:56:42.142
Okay, look.

00:56:42.232 --> 00:56:45.066
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...

00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:48.649
and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...

00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:51.526
Vision's stone.

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:52.941
Then we have to protect it.

00:56:53.118 --> 00:56:54.734
No, we have to destroy it.

00:56:56.914 --> 00:56:58.200
I've been giving
a good deal of thought

00:56:58.290 --> 00:56:59.280
to this entity in my head.

00:56:59.458 --> 00:57:00.949
About its nature.

00:57:01.501 --> 00:57:03.663
But also its composition.

00:57:03.837 --> 00:57:05.829
I think if it were exposed

00:57:05.923 --> 00:57:07.755
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...

00:57:07.925 --> 00:57:11.760
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

00:57:13.347 --> 00:57:15.509
its molecular integrity
could fail.

00:57:16.058 --> 00:57:18.300
Yeah, and you with it.

00:57:18.769 --> 00:57:20.226
We're not having
this conversation.

00:57:20.395 --> 00:57:22.387
VISION: Eliminating the stone
is the only way

00:57:22.481 --> 00:57:24.473
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.

00:57:25.025 --> 00:57:27.233
That's too high a price.

00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:34.107
Only you have
the power to pay it.

00:57:38.372 --> 00:57:40.409
Thanos threatens
half the universe.

00:57:40.582 --> 00:57:43.120
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:44.704
But it should.

00:57:47.214 --> 00:57:48.580
We don't trade lives, Vision.

00:57:48.757 --> 00:57:50.714
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

00:57:50.884 --> 00:57:52.671
to save how many
millions of people?

00:57:52.844 --> 00:57:54.881
Tell me,
why is this any different?

00:57:55.055 --> 00:57:57.342
BANNER: Because you might
have a choice.

00:57:58.642 --> 00:57:59.974
Your mind is made up

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.427
of a complex construct
of overlays.

00:58:02.604 --> 00:58:06.188
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.

00:58:06.358 --> 00:58:08.099
All of them mixed together,

00:58:08.193 --> 00:58:09.684
all of them
learning from one another.

00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:11.811
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?

00:58:11.989 --> 00:58:15.073
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...

00:58:15.242 --> 00:58:16.653
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.

00:58:16.743 --> 00:58:18.200
Perhaps the best parts.

00:58:18.537 --> 00:58:19.869
Can we do that?

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:21.616
Not me, not here.

00:58:22.624 --> 00:58:24.160
RHODES: Well,
you better find someone

00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:25.412
and somewhere fast.

00:58:25.585 --> 00:58:26.951
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys

00:58:27.045 --> 00:58:28.252
have your old rooms back.

00:58:31.299 --> 00:58:32.881
I know somewhere.

00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:48.765
OKOYE: The Kingsguard

00:58:48.859 --> 00:58:50.145
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

00:58:50.318 --> 00:58:51.854
And the Border Tribe?

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:53.902
Those that are left.

00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:56.314
Send word
to the Jabari as well.

00:58:56.491 --> 00:58:58.574
M'Baku likes a good fight.

(SPEAKS XHOSA)

00:59:00.871 --> 00:59:02.578
(IN ENGLISH)
And what of this one?

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:05.323
This one may be tired of war.

00:59:05.667 --> 00:59:08.705
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.

00:59:31.359 --> 00:59:32.941
Where's the fight?

00:59:33.862 --> 00:59:35.273
On its way.

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:44.287

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:50.580

00:59:53.673 --> 00:59:56.256
In all the time
I've served Thanos...

00:59:58.136 --> 01:00:00.128
I have never failed him.

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:08.311
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.062
with the Time Stone
still attached

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:12.310
to your vaguely
irritating person...

01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:15.067
there would be judgment.

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:22.574
(GRUNTING SOFTLY)

01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:25.198

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.030
(GRUNTS)

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:30.032
the stone.

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:43.880
Wow, you're a seriously

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:45.055
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:47.217
SPIDER-MAN: Yeah, uh,
speaking of loyalty...

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:48.801
STARK: What the...

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:50.720
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:51.933
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:53.097
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:54.432
- about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.

01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:55.516
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.

01:00:55.694 --> 01:00:57.731
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:58.894
God damn it.

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:01.860
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.

01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:03.365
- What did you just say?
- (STUTTERS) I take that back.

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:04.821
And now, I'm here in space.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:07.408
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:09.664
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.074
This is a one-way ticket.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:12.704
You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.

01:01:12.794 --> 01:01:13.784
No, I did think this through.

01:01:13.879 --> 01:01:15.495
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.163
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.922
if there's no neighborhood.

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:22.210
Okay, that didn't
really make sense,

01:01:22.304 --> 01:01:23.636
but you know
what I'm trying to say.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:28.633
(BREATHES SHAKILY)
Come on. We got a situation.

01:01:29.644 --> 01:01:30.634
See him down there?
He's in trouble.

01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:31.719
What's your plan?

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:32.974
- Go.
- Um...

01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:35.059
Okay, okay... Uh...

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:38.567
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, <i>Aliens?</i>

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:40.645
(SCREAMING)

01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:44.365
EBONY MAW:
Painful, aren't they?

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.119
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:50.871
- And any one of them...
- (THUD)

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:58.170

<i>Saving his life is more

01:02:05.013 --> 01:02:06.754
You've saved nothing.

01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:09.633
Your powers
are inconsequential

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:10.933
compared to mine.

01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:12.969
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

we haven't officially met.

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:49.054
Cool.

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:52.516
We gotta turn
this ship around.

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:54.681
STARK: Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:56.220
No, I want to protect
the stone.

01:02:56.398 --> 01:02:57.605
STARK: And I want you
to thank me.

01:02:57.691 --> 01:02:59.182
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:02.067
DR. STRANGE: For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?

01:03:02.237 --> 01:03:04.479
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.

01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:05.646
I seriously don't know

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:06.901
how you fit your head
into that helmet.

01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:09.317
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:10.985
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

01:03:11.162 --> 01:03:13.074
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:14.830
And due to that fact,

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:16.248
we're now
in a flying doughnut...

01:03:16.418 --> 01:03:18.080
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:20.165
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.

01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:21.328
The adults are talking.

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:24.089
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

01:03:24.259 --> 01:03:25.875
What is he, your ward?

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:27.042
No.

01:03:27.554 --> 01:03:29.420
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:31.304
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...

01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:33.474
I'm Spider-Man, then.

01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:35.927
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

01:03:36.021 --> 01:03:37.011
Thing's on autopilot.

01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:38.895
DR. STRANGE:
Can we control it?

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:40.977
Fly us home?

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:44.977
- Stark?
- Yeah.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:46.396
Can you get us home?

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:47.814
Yeah, I heard you.

01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:51.575
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:53.736
Under no circumstances

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:56.368
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:57.702
I don't think
you quite understand

01:03:57.792 --> 01:03:58.782
what's at stake here.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.293
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:04.206
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:05.964
Since he sent an army
to New York

01:04:06.051 --> 01:04:07.587
and now he's back.

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:09.673
And I don't know what to do.

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:11.007
So I'm not so sure

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:12.884
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:16.677
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:19.061
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:21.973
So I say we take
the fight to him.

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:23.140
Doctor.

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:26.523
Do you concur?

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:31.573
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.697
But you have to understand...

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.533
if it comes to saving you

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:39.081
or the kid
or the Time Stone...

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:42.084
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

01:04:42.921 --> 01:04:46.585
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:50.043
Nice. Good, moral compass.

(SIGHS) All right, kid.

01:04:56.768 --> 01:04:57.804
You're an Avenger now.

01:05:34.389 --> 01:05:36.676
THANOS: I thought
you might be hungry.

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.356
I always hated that chair.

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:52.609
THANOS: So I've been told.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:57.197
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:05:59.445
I hated this room.

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:01.659
This ship.

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:03.620
I hated my life.

01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:10.289
THANOS: You told me that too.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:14.836
Every day.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.597
For almost 20 years.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:24.558
I was a child
when you took me.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.726
I saved you.

01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:31.268
No.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:36.273
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:37.609
Going to bed hungry...

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:39.823
scrounging for scraps.

01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:42.906
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:45.036
I'm the one who stopped that.

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:47.375
Do you know
what's happened since then?

01:06:47.545 --> 01:06:49.161
The children born...

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:53.165
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:54.584
It's a paradise.

01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:59.129
Because you murdered
half the planet.

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:02.133
A small price to pay
for salvation.

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:03.342
You're insane.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.477
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:08.393
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

01:07:08.983 --> 01:07:12.943
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

01:07:13.404 --> 01:07:14.485
It needs correction.

01:07:14.614 --> 01:07:15.980
You don't know that!

01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:19.567
I'm the only one
who knows that.

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:24.576
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:27.745
For a time...

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:34.040
you had that same will...

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:38.048
as you fought by my side.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:39.966
Daughter.

01:07:40.765 --> 01:07:42.552
I'm not your daughter.

01:07:44.936 --> 01:07:47.679
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:49.934
And, in doing so,

01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:52.232
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

01:07:55.196 --> 01:07:57.984
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:03.869
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:05.283
(THANOS SIGHS)

01:08:05.373 --> 01:08:07.160
I am disappointed.

01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:10.417
But not because
you didn't find it.

01:08:14.132 --> 01:08:15.748
But because you did.

01:08:17.218 --> 01:08:18.959
And you lied.

01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:37.186
GAMORA: Nebula.

01:08:44.454 --> 01:08:45.786
Don't do this.

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:47.162
THANOS: Some time ago,

01:08:47.248 --> 01:08:49.956
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:51.116
Please don't do this.

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:53.497
THANOS:
And very nearly succeeded.

01:08:54.172 --> 01:08:55.629
So I brought her here.

01:08:57.175 --> 01:08:58.416
To talk.

01:09:00.762 --> 01:09:02.094
(SCREAMING)

01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:08.472
Stop. Stop it.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:16.692
I swear to you on my life.

01:09:17.195 --> 01:09:19.482
I never found the Soul Stone.

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:25.200

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:26.702
<i>You know
what he's about to do.</i>

01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:29.454
<i>He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.</i>

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:30.740
<i>- All of them.
- He can never get them all.</i>

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:31.865
NEBULA: <i>He will!</i>

01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:33.916
<i>He can't, Nebula.</i>

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:36.420
<i>Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...</i>

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:39.377
<i>and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.</i>

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.217
You're strong.

01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:49.257
Me.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.436
You're generous.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:55.764
Me.

01:09:57.777 --> 01:10:00.190
But I never taught you to lie.

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:02.980
That's why
you're so bad at it.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:09.741
Where is the Soul Stone?

We're not looking.
What's there to see?

What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.

I am Groot.

out into space

You speak Groot?

01:11:07.555 --> 01:11:09.342
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:10.551
I am Groot.

01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:12.717
You'll know when we're close.

Nidavellir's forge harnesses

01:11:14.562 --> 01:11:16.770
the blazing power
of a neutron star.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:21.601
It's the birthplace
of my hammer.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.061
It's truly awesome.

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:33.237
Okay, time to be the captain.

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:39.788
So, dead brother, huh?

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.295
Yeah, that could be annoying.

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:44.665
Well, he's been dead before.

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:48.673
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:51.471
And you said
your sister and your dad?

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:52.927
Both dead.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:55.221
But still got a mom, though?

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:56.969
Killed by a dark elf.

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.136
A best friend?

01:11:58.272 --> 01:11:59.604
Stabbed through the heart.

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:06.149
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:09.864
Absolutely.

01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:13.527
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...

they're all
tremendous motivators.

Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...

01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:23.749
he's the toughest there is.

01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:25.960
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:27.669
He's never fought me twice.

01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:30.043
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.

01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:32.463
It better be some hammer.

01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:35.010

You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

01:12:39.647 --> 01:12:41.684
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:43.815
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:44.891
but none succeeded.

01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:48.483
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:51.444
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:53.483
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

01:12:53.661 --> 01:12:55.448
Fate wills it so.

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:56.870
Mmm-hmm.

01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:58.788

01:13:05.172 --> 01:13:06.708

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:21.887

Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.

to kill that crapsack...

you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.

- What's this?
- What's it look like?

01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:40.869
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:42.289
He gave you his eye?

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:43.576
No, he gave me 100 credits.

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.712
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

01:13:48.633 --> 01:13:49.874
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

to protect us.

PETER: The hell happened
to this planet?

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:00.117
It's eight degrees
off its axis.

01:22:00.207 --> 01:22:02.415

is all over the place.

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:06.540
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:10.123
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:11.541
Or at least
the beginnings of one.

01:22:11.718 --> 01:22:13.050
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

01:22:13.137 --> 01:22:14.344
pin him down,
get what we need.

01:22:14.513 --> 01:22:16.175
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:17.301
We just want the gauntlet.

- (YAWNING)

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:22.514

I'm breaking it down? Huh?

01:22:22.646 --> 01:22:23.636
Did you hear what I said?

01:22:24.481 --> 01:22:26.723
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:27.981
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:30.986

isn't really what they do.

01:22:31.155 --> 01:22:32.646
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?

01:22:32.823 --> 01:22:34.405

01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:35.816

Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?

01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:48.540
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

01:22:51.258 --> 01:22:52.544
STARK: We gotta coalesce.

01:22:52.718 --> 01:22:54.334
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:56.798

All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:03.768
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...

01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:05.849
and that way
it might be really good.

01:23:06.023 --> 01:23:07.980
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:10.267
- STARK: What dance-off?
- (STAMMERS) It's nothing.

01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:11.480
Like in <i>Footloose,</i> the movie?

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:13.019
Exactly like <i>Footloose.</i>

01:23:13.572 --> 01:23:15.063
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.356

Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

01:25:13.984 --> 01:25:15.145
THANOS: You know us?

01:25:15.319 --> 01:25:19.859

who journey here.

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:28.196

THANOS: How is it you know
this place so well?

01:25:56.943 --> 01:26:01.278
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:04.448
I even held one in my hand.

01:26:04.618 --> 01:26:08.658
But it cast me out,
banished me here.

I cannot possess.

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:24.506

Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

a certain wisdom.

whoever possesses it...

understands its power...

01:26:52.332 --> 01:26:56.076
the stone demands a sacrifice.

01:26:56.253 --> 01:26:57.789
Of what?

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:00.170
In order to take the stone,

01:27:00.257 --> 01:27:02.670
you must lose
that which you love.

01:27:05.595 --> 01:27:06.881
A soul...

01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:08.797

01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:29.192
a moment...

01:27:30.537 --> 01:27:32.620
when you got
what you deserved.

01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:37.120
And I was always
so disappointed.

01:27:40.714 --> 01:27:42.171
But now...

01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:49.220
You kill and torture...

01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:53.175
and you call it mercy.

01:27:57.272 --> 01:27:59.355
The universe has judged you.

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:05.403
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:08.439

01:28:09.826 --> 01:28:11.692

01:28:12.662 --> 01:28:14.494
Because you love nothing.

01:28:15.207 --> 01:28:16.823

01:28:22.464 --> 01:28:23.625

01:28:53.411 --> 01:28:56.074

01:28:58.542 --> 01:29:00.704
